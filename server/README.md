# APPRIS web server

## Overview


## Prerequisites

### Git (NOT DEVELOPED)
- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-github]
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation)

### Node.js
- Generic [installation instructions][node-generic].
- Mac DMG [here][node-mac]
- Windows download from [here][node-windows]. (You will also need [7 Zip] to unzip the node archive)
  (and don't forget to add `node.exe` to  your executable path)


## Workings of the application


### Running the app during development

1. run `./scripts/web-server.js`
2. navigate your browser to ``http://local.es:3000/ to see the app running in your browser.

### Running the app as daemon

1. forever start scripts/web-server.js


### Running unit tests (NOT DEVELOPED)

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma karma-jasmine karma-chrome-launcher`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing (NOT DEVELOPED)

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* Install the Karma ng-scenario adapter with `npm install -g karma-ng-scenario`
* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`
