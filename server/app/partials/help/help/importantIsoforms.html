        As part of the work with APPRIS, we are investigating patterns in alternative splicing 
        at the protein level. Since the proteins are the functional end product of coding genes, 
        we believe that it is important to look at trends at the protein level, rather than the 
        transcript level, where a certain amount of biological and technical noise can often 
        obscure any signal. There is little cost associated with this noise at the transcript level, 
        but large amounts of misfolded proteins are potentially damaging at the protein level, and 
        will be controlled at some level, though we do not yet know the extent of this control, 
        or the processes behind it.

        However, we do know that there are numerous examples of functional alternative isoforms, and 
        as part of our work, we will attempt to list as many as we can. List of functional isoforms that 
        we find will be linked from this page when we find time to add them. The isoforms are also 
        listed in the individual papers.

        Note that the pairs of transcripts listed in these files are tied to a single release of 
        Ensembl/GENCODE. The sequences or stable IDs might change in subsequent versions. Transcripts 
        may appear in more than one list.
