 <h4>Principal Isoform flags</h4>
 <p>APPRIS selects a single CDS variant for each gene as the 'PRINCIPAL' isoform based on the range
     of protein features. Note that since multiple transcripts may have the same CDS, it is
     possible for more than one transcript to be annotated as the principal variant.</p>
 <p>Principal isoforms are tagged with the numbers 1 to 5, with 1 being the most reliable. Note that
     under the classic transcript selection system (see below) we also regard PRINCIPAL:2 isoforms
     as highly reliable, while under the TRIFID transcript selection system (see below) we regard
     PRINCIPAL:2 and PRINCIPAL:3 isoforms as highly reliable.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:1</strong>
   <p>Transcript(s) predicted to code for the main functional isoform based solely on the core
       modules in the APPRIS database. Core modules map protein structural and functional
       information and cross-species conservation to the annotated transcripts.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>At this stage many transcripts are flagged as <strong>"MINOR"</strong> transcripts. MINOR
     transcripts are not considered in any subsequent steps.</p>
 <p>When APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant (approximately 25% of
     human protein-coding genes), the database chooses two or more of the CDS variants as
     "candidates" to be the principal variant. These are assigned tags from PRINCIPAL:2 to
     PRINCIPAL:5, or ALTERNATIVE:1 or ALTERNATIVE:2, according to the next selection process:
     
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:2</strong>
   <p>Given two or more principal transcript candidates identified by the APPRIS core modules,
       APPRIS can tag a candidate transcript as PRINCIPAL:2 if it has the best raw TRIFID score and its
       raw TRIFID score is greater than any other candidate by a sufficiently wide margin. TRIFID is a
       machine learning classifier based on APPRIS and external database input which we have found
       to be a reliable indicator of isoform functionality. For more information about TRIFID,
       please consult the <a href="https://github.com/fpozoc/trifid" target="_blank">TRIFID GitHub
       repository</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:3</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and no single
       variant has a TRIFID score exceeding that of the other candidates by a sufficient margin,
       APPRIS selects from among the remaining candidates the variant with the most supporting
       proteomics evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:4</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and no single
       isoform from among the remaining candidates has strong proteomics evidence support or a
       dominant TRIFID score, APPRIS selects the remaining candidate with the best raw TRIFID
       score.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:5</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and none of the
       candidate variants have a sufficiently strong proteomics evidence base or TRIFID score,
       APPRIS selects the longest of the candidate isoforms as the principal variant.</p>
   <p>In the small number of cases where two or more candidates remain that cannot be distinguished
       even by isoform length, a simple string sort is applied to the transcript identifiers of
       remaining candidates, and the candidate with the first-sorting transcript ID is arbitrarily
       selected as the principal variant.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>For genes with PRINCIPAL:2 to PRINCIPAL:5 isoforms "candidate" variants not chosen as principal
     are labeled in the following way:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>ALTERNATIVE:1</strong>
   <p>Candidate transcript(s) models that are conserved in at least three tested non-primate
       species.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>ALTERNATIVE:2</strong>
   <p>Candidate transcript(s) models that appear to be conserved in fewer than three tested
       non-primate species.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
