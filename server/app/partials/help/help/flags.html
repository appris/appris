 <h4>Principal Isoform flags</h4>
 <p>APPRIS selects a single CDS variant for each gene as the 'PRINCIPAL' isoform based on the range
     of protein features. Note that since multiple transcripts may have the same CDS, it is
     possible for more than one transcript to be annotated as the principal variant.</p>
 <p>Principal isoforms are tagged with the numbers 1 to 5, with 1 being the most reliable. Note that
     under the classic transcript selection system (see below) we also regard PRINCIPAL:2 isoforms
     as highly reliable, while under the TRIFID transcript selection system (see below) we regard
     PRINCIPAL:2 and PRINCIPAL:3 isoforms as highly reliable.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:1</strong>
   <p>Transcript(s) predicted to code for the main functional isoform based solely on the core
       modules in the APPRIS database. Core modules map protein structural and functional
       information and cross-species conservation to the annotated transcripts.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>At this stage many transcripts are flagged as <strong>"MINOR"</strong> transcripts. MINOR
     transcripts are not considered in any subsequent steps.</p>
 <p>When APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant (approximately 25% of
     human protein-coding genes), the database chooses two or more of the CDS variants as
     "candidates" to be the principal variant. These are assigned tags from PRINCIPAL:2 to
     PRINCIPAL:5, or ALTERNATIVE:1 or ALTERNATIVE:2, according to one of two selection processes
     The 'TRIFID' selection process is used on datasets for which TRIFID scores are available,
     (e.g. Gencode33/Ensembl99 human annotation), while the 'Classic' selection process is used
     for all other datasets.</p>
 <h5>TRIFID transcript selection</h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:2</strong>
   <p>Given two or more principal transcript candidates identified by the APPRIS core modules,
       APPRIS can tag a candidate transcript as PRINCIPAL:2 if it has the best raw TRIFID score and its
       raw TRIFID score is greater than any other candidate by a sufficiently wide margin. TRIFID is a
       machine learning classifier based on APPRIS and external database input which we have found
       to be a reliable indicator of isoform functionality. For more information about TRIFID,
       please consult the <a href="https://gitlab.com/bu_cnio/trifid" target="_blank">TRIFID GitLab
       repository</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:3</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and no single
       variant has a TRIFID score exceeding that of the other candidates by a sufficient margin,
       APPRIS selects from among the remaining candidates the variant with the most supporting
       proteomics evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:4</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and no single
       isoform from among the remaining candidates has strong proteomics evidence support or a
       dominant TRIFID score, APPRIS selects the remaining candidate with the best raw TRIFID
       score.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:5</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and none of the
       candidate variants have a sufficiently strong proteomics evidence base or TRIFID score,
       APPRIS selects the longest of the candidate isoforms as the principal variant.</p>
   <p>In the small number of cases where two or more candidates remain that cannot be distinguished
       even by isoform length, a simple string sort is applied to the transcript identifiers of
       remaining candidates, and the candidate with the first-sorting transcript ID is arbitrarily
       selected as the principal variant.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5>Classic transcript selection</h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:2</strong>
   <p>When APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and one of the
       principal transcript candidates has a distinct CCDS identifier, it is selected as the
       principal variant for that gene. A CCDS identifier shows that there is consensus between
       RefSeq and GENCODE/Ensembl for that variant, guaranteeing that the variant has cDNA
       support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:3</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and multiple
       candidates have distinct CCDS identifiers, APPRIS selects the variant with the lowest CCDS
       identifier as the principal variant. The lower the CCDS identifier, the earlier it was
       annotated.</p>
   <p>Consensus CDS annotated earlier are likely to have more cDNA evidence. Consecutive CCDS
       identifiers are not included in this flag, since they will have been annotated in the
       same release of CCDS. These are distinguished with the next flag.</p>
   <p>In addition, if there are multiple variants with distinct (but consecutive) CCDS identifiers,
       APPRIS chooses the variant for which all splice junctions are supported by at least one
       non-suspect mRNA. This information is reported by the method Transcript Support Level (TSL),
       which is a method to highlight well-supported and poorly-supported transcript models for
       users. The method relies on the primary data that can support full-length transcript
       structure: mRNA and EST alignments supplied by UCSC and Ensembl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:4</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal CDS, there are multiple
       variants with distinct (but consecutive) CCDS identifiers, and all the splice junctions are
       not well-supported, APPRIS selects the longest CCDS isoform as the principal variant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>PRINCIPAL:5</strong>
   <p>Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and none of the
       candidate variants are annotated by CCDS, APPRIS selects the longest of the candidate
       isoforms as the principal variant.</p>
   <p>In the small number of cases where two or more candidates remain that cannot be distinguished
       even by isoform length, a simple string sort is applied to the transcript identifiers of
       remaining candidates, and the candidate with the first-sorting transcript ID is arbitrarily
       selected as the principal variant.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>For genes with PRINCIPAL:2 to PRINCIPAL:5 isoforms "candidate" variants not chosen as principal
     are labeled in the following way:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>ALTERNATIVE:1</strong>
   <p>Candidate transcript(s) models that are conserved in at least three tested non-primate
       species.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>ALTERNATIVE:2</strong>
   <p>Candidate transcript(s) models that appear to be conserved in fewer than three tested
       non-primate species.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
