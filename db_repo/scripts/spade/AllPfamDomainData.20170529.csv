Defensin_3	PF08131.10	0	2	This family consists of the defensin-like peptides (DLPs) isolated from platypus venom. These DLPs show similar three-dimensional fold to that of beta-defensin-12 and sodium-channel neurotoxin Shl. However the side chains known to be functionally important to beta-defensin-12 and Shl are not conserved in DLPs. This suggests a different biological function. Consistent with this contention, DLPs have been shown to possess no anti-microbial properties and have no observable activity on rat dorsal-root-ganglion sodium-channel currents [1].

Sex_peptide	PF08138.10	1	2	This family consists of Sex Peptides (SP) that are found in Drosophila. On mating, Drosophila females decreases her remating rate and increases her egg-laying rate due, in part, to the transfer of SP from the male to the female. SP are found in seminal fluids transferred from the male to the female during mating. The male seminal fluid proteins are referred to as accessory gland proteins (Acps). The SP is one of the most interesting Acps and plays an important role in reproduction [1].	Sex_peptide	Family	7	54	55	99.47	Changed	Sex peptide (SP) family	2LAQ	0.1181387783	55	-1	-1.8518518519

For most species there is the potential for producing two sulfakinin peptides one have a short sulfakinin sequence The function of the sulfakinins is difficult to assess. For the American cockroach, various forms of the endogenous sulfakinins have been shown to be active on the hindgut, and also on the heart. In C. vomitoria the peptides act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, linking the brain with all thoracic and abdominal ganglia. In adults of P. monodon they appear to be restricted to a few neurones in the brain with a neural pathway extending along to the ventral thoracic and abdominal ganglia [1].

Apo-VLDL-II	PF05418.10	0	3	This family consists of several avian apovitellenin I sequences. As part of the avian reproductive effort, large quantities of triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles are transported by receptor-mediated endocytosis into the female germ cells. Although the oocytes are surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells harbouring high levels of active lipoprotein lipase, non-lipolysed VLDL is transported into the yolk. This is because VLDL particles from laying chickens are protected from lipolysis by apolipoprotein (apo)-VLDL-II, a potent dimeric lipoprotein lipase inhibitor [1]. Apo-VLDL-II is produced in the liver and secreted into the blood stream when induced by estrogen production in female birds.

SelP_C	PF04593.13	1	3	SelP is the only known eukaryotic selenoprotein that contains multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues, and accounts for more than 50% of the selenium content of rat and human plasma [1]. It is thought to be glycosylated [2]. SelP may have antioxidant properties. It can attach to epithelial cells, and may protect vascular endothelial cells against peroxynitrite toxicity [1]. The high selenium content of SelP suggests that it may be involved in selenium intercellular transport or storage [2]. The promoter structure of bovine SelP suggest that it may be involved in countering heavy metal intoxication, and may also have a developmental function [3]. The N terminal region always contains one Sec residue, and this is separated from the C terminal region (9-16 sec residues) by a histidine-rich sequence [2]. The large number of Sec residues in the C-terminal portion of SelP suggest CC that it may be involved in selenium transport or storage. However, it is also possible that this region has a redox function [2].	SelP_C	Family	11	116.4	57	33.29	Changed	Selenoprotein P, C terminal region		0.3861174465	130	-13.6	-11.6838487973

Apelin	PF15360.5	1	8	Apelin is among the most potent stimulators of cardiac contractility known. The apelin-APJ signaling pathway is an important novel mediator of cardiovascular control [1]. Apelin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes where it is co-expressed with apelin receptor (APJ) in adipocytes. It suppresses adipogenesis through MAPK kinase/ERK dependent pathways and prevents lipid droplet fragmentation, thereby inhibiting basal lipolysis through AMP kinase dependent enhancement of perilipin expression. It also inhibits hormone-stimulated acute lipolysis through decreasing perilipin phosphorylation. Apelin induces a decrease of free fatty acid release via its dual inhibition on adipogenesis and lipolysis [2]. As a vaso-active and vascular cell growth-regulating peptide Apelin is a target of the BMP pathway, the TGF-beta/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) system - a major pathway for angiogenesis [3].

EKLF_TAD1	PF16832.4	1	2	This family is the first part of the minimal transactivation domain of erythroid-specific transcription factor EKFL in craniates. EKLF plays an important role in red blood cell development; it is posttranslationally modified by UBI on several lysine residues, and its turnover in the cell is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In the first 90 residues at the N-terminus EKLF carries a minimal transactivation or TAD domain that is highly acidic. This minimal TAD of EKLF can be further subdivided into two independent domains EKLF_TAD1 (residues 1-40) and EKLF_TAD2 (residues 51-90), Pfam:PF16833, that are both capable of independently activating transcription. TAD1, is able to form a non-covalent interaction with ubiquitin. Both TAD1 and TAd2 are highly acidic and carry a PEST (sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) region. Deletion of either PEST domain significantly slows down degradation of EKLF by ubiquitin. The minimal TAD has an overlapping activation/degradation function that is critical for the role of EKLF in red blood cell development [1].

SSTK-IP directly binds to HSP70, is found associated with HSP70 and HSP90 in cells, and facilitates HSP90-dependent enzymatic activation of SSTK. SSTK is a small serine/threonine kinase expressed post-meiotically and essential for male fertility along with two other serine threonine kinases. SSTK is one of the smallest protein kinases, consisting only of N- and C-lobes of a kinase catalytic domain, and forms stable associations with heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90. SSTK-IP, its interacting protein, thus represents the first germ cell-specific co-chaperone and protein kinase that requires the HSP90 machinery for catalytic activation [1].

EKLF_TAD2	PF16833.4	1	12	This family is the second part of the minimal transactivation domain of erythroid-specific transcription factor EKFL in craniates. EKLF plays an important role in red blood cell development; it is post-translationally modified by ubiquitin on several lysine residues, and its turnover in the cell is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In the first 90 residues at the N-terminus EKLF carries a minimal transactivation or TAD domain that is highly acidic. This minimal TAD of EKLF can be further subdivided into two independent domains EKLF_TAD1 (residues 1-40), Pfam:PF16832, and EKLF_TAD2 (residues 51-90) that are both capable of independently activating transcription. Both TAD1 and TAD2 are highly acidic and carry a PEST (sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) region. Deletion of either PEST domain significantly slows down degradation of EKLF by ubiquitin. The minimal TAD has an overlapping activation/degradation function that is critical for the role of EKLF in red blood cell development [1].

CENP-R	PF06729.11	1	11	This family consists of mammalian kinetochore sub-complex proteins CENP-R, also referred to as nuclear receptor co-activator NRIF3 proteins. NRIF3 exhibits a distinct receptor specificity in interacting with and potentiating the activity of only TRs and RXRs but not other examined nuclear receptors. NRIF3 as a co-regulator that possesses both transactivation and transrepression domains and/or functions. Collectively, the NRIF3 family of co-regulators may play dual roles in mediating both positive and negative regulatory effects on gene expression [1]. CENP-R is one of the 15 components that make up the constitutive centromere associated complex (CCAN) part of the kinetochore. A sub-complex of CCAN, consisting of CENP-P/O/R/Q/U self-assembles on kinetochores with varying stoichiometry and undergoes a pre-mitotic maturation step. Kinetochore assembly is a cell cycle regulated multi-step process. The initial step occurs during interphase and involves loading of the 15-subunit constitutive centromere associated complex (CCAN). Kinetochores are multi-protein megadalton assemblies that are required for attachment of microtubules to centromeres and, in turn, the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis [2,3].

Gypsy	PF07253.10	1	4	This family consists of several Gypsy/Env proteins from Drosophila and Ceratitis fruit fly species. Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster. Phylogenetic studies suggest that occasional horizontal transfer events of gypsy occur between Drosophila species. Gypsy possesses infective properties associated with the products of the envelope gene that might be at the origin of these interspecies transfers [1]. This family contains many members with full-length matches; however, it also includes a number of very short sequences and short matches of sequences with other unrelated domains on them, which cannot be excluded. These matches may represent remnants of once-functional genes.	Gypsy	Family	43	205	21	73.34	Changed	Gypsy protein		0.8868013144	456	-251	-122.4390243902

Izumo is a typical type I membrane glycoprotein with one immunoglobulin-like domain and a putative N-glycoside link motif - glycosylation site. The full-length protein, eg Swiss:Q8IYV9, is a molecule with a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain. It is thought that Izumo proteins bind to putative Izumo receptors on the oocyte. Izumo is not detectable on the surface of fresh sperm but becomes exposed only after an exocytotic process, the acrosome reaction, has occurred. Studies have shown that knock-out mice (Izumo-/- males) were sterile despite normal mating behaviour and ejaculation, indicating the importance of the protein in fertilisation [1]. There is a conserved GCL sequence motif. Izumo expression has been found to be testis-specific [1,2].

It interacts with the N-terminus of histone H4 thereby mediating the association between histone H4 and PRMT5, PRMT5, the Janus kinase-binding protein 1 that catalyses the formation of symmetric dimethyl-arginine residues in proteins. COPR5 is specifically required for histone H4 'Arg-3' methylation mediated by PRMT5, but not histone H3 'Arg-8' methylation, suggesting that it modulates the substrate specificity of PRMT5.

IFNGR1	PF07140.10	1	7	This family consists of several eukaryotic and viral interferon gamma receptor proteins. Molecular interactions among cytokines and cytokine receptors in eukaryotes form the basis of many cell-signaling pathways relevant to immune function. Human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signals through a multimeric receptor complex consisting of two different but structurally related transmembrane chains: the high-affinity receptor-binding subunit (IFN-gammaRalpha) and a species specific accessory factor (AF-1 or IFN-gammaRbeta). The vaccinia viral interferon gamma receptor has been shown to be secreted from infected cells during early infection [2]. The structure has been halved such that the N-terminus of this family is now represented by Tissue_fac Pfam:PF01108.

Apo-CIII	PF05778.11	1	16	This family consists of several mammalian apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII) sequences. Apolipoprotein C-III is a 79-residue glycoprotein. It is synthesised in the intestine and liver as part of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Owing to its positive correlation with plasma triglyceride (Tg) levels, Apo-CIII is suggested to play a role in Tg metabolism and is therefore of interest regarding atherosclerosis. However, unlike other apolipoproteins such as Apo-AI, Apo E or CII for which many naturally occurring mutations are known, the structure-function relationships of apo C-III remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that apo C-III inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, as shown by in vitro experiments. Another suggestion, is that elevated levels of Apo-CIII displace other apolipoproteins at the lipoprotein surface, modifying their clearance from plasma [1].

Inactivation domain 1 (ID1, residues 1-38) consists of a flexible N-terminus anchored at a 5-turn helix, and is thought to work by occluding the ion pathway, as is the case with a classical ball domain. Inactivation domain 2 (ID2, residues 40-50) is a 2.5 turn helix with a high proportion of hydrophobic residues that probably serves to attach ID1 to the cytoplasmic face of the channel.

DMP1	PF07263.10	1	15	This family consists of several mammalian dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) sequences. The dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 4q21 [1]. DMP1 is a bone and teeth specific protein initially identified from mineralised dentin. DMP1 is primarily localised in the nuclear compartment of undifferentiated osteoblasts. In the nucleus, DMP1 acts as a transcriptional component for activation of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin. During the early phase of osteoblast maturation, Ca(2+) surges into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, triggering the phosphorylation of DMP1 by a nuclear isoform of casein kinase II. This phosphorylated DMP1 is then exported out into the extracellular matrix, where it regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite. DMP1 is a unique molecule that initiates osteoblast differentiation by transcription in the nucleus and orchestrates mineralised matrix formation extracellularly, at later stages of osteoblast maturation [2]. The DMP1 gene has been found to be ectopically expressed in lung cancer although the reason for this is unknown [3].

Recently it has been shown in human testis to be localised to the equatorial segment of ejaculated human sperm. The finding of a TSKS family member in mature sperm suggests that this family of kinases might play a role in sperm function [2]. TSKS is localised during spermiogenesis to the centrioles of post-meiotic spermatids, where it reaches its greatest concentration during the period of flagellogenesis [3].

The domain allows docking of TRADD onto 'tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor' (TRAF): the binding is at the beta-sandwich domain, away from the coiled-coil domain. Binding ensures the recruitment of cIAPs to the signaling complex, which may be important for direct caspase-8 inhibition and the immediate suppression of apoptosis at the apical point of the cascade [1].

The very N-terminus of titin, composed of two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, referred to as Z1 and Z2, interacts with the N-terminal region (residues 1-53) of telethonin, mediating the antiparallel assembly of two Z1Z2 domains. The C-terminus of the telethonin appears to induce dimerisation of this 2:1 titin/telethonin structure which thus forms a complex necessary for myofibril assembly and maintenance of the intact Z-disk of skeletal and cardiac muscles [1].

ESR1_C	PF12743.6	1	19	This is the very C-terminal region of a subfamily of nuclear receptors that includes oestrogen receptors and other subfamily 3 group A members. The actual function of this region is not known, but the domain is absent from all the other types of nuclear receptors. Oestrogen receptors modulate AP-1-dependent transcription [1] through two distinct mechanisms: via protein-protein interactions on DNA; and via non-genomic actions. The mechanism used depends on the cellular localisation of the receptor. In addition to the more extensively studied cross-talk on DNA, additional non-genomic actions might be very important in target tissues in which membrane-associated ERs are found. These non-genomic actions probably contribute to the overall physiological responses mediated by ligand-bound ERs [2] and might possibly be mediated via this C-terminal domain.

CENP-P	PF13096.5	1	3	CENP-P is one of the components that assembles onto the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere. The centromere, which is the basic element of chromosome inheritance, is epigenetically determined in mammals. CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, assembles an array of nucleosomes and it is this that seems to be the prime candidate for specifying centromere identity. CENP-A nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T, CENP-U(50), CENP-C and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Additionally, there are seven other subunits which make up the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere, CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S, also assembling on the CENP-A NAC [2].

Bcl-2_BAD	PF10514.8	1	8	BAD is a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by phosphorylation in response to survival factors [1]. Binding of BAD to mitochondria is thought to be exclusively mediated by its BH3 domain. Membrane localisation of BAD mediates membrane translocation of Bcl-XL. The C-terminal part of BAD is sufficient for membrane binding. There are two segments with differing lipid-binding preferences, LBD1 and LBD2, that are responsible for this binding: (i) LBD1 located in the proximity of the BH3 domain (amino acids 122-131) and (ii) LBD2, the putative C-terminal alpha-helix-5 [2]. Phosphorylation-regulated 14-3-3 protein binding may expose the cholesterol-preferring LBD1 and bury the LBD2, thereby mediating translocation of BAD to raft-like micro-domains [3].

They are formed primarily by three elements of regular secondary structure: a 12-residue alpha helix, a twisted five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, and a second, two-stranded, antiparallel sheet. The two beta-sheets lie at roughly right angles to each other, with the helix nestled between the two, adopting an SRCR fold. The exact function of this domain has not been identified, though it probably may serve to orient the protease domain or place it in the vicinity of its substrate [1].

This protein anchors PKA, for its role in regulating PKA-mediated gene transcription in both somatic cells and oocytes, by binding to its regulatory subunits, RI and RII, hence being known as a dual-specific AKAP [1]. The 25 crucial amino acids of RII-binding domains in general form structurally conserved amphipathic helices with unrelated sequences; hydrophobic amino acid residues form the backbone of the interaction and hydrogen bond- and salt-bridge-forming amino acid residues increase the affinity of the interaction [2].

CYLD_phos_site	PF16607.4	1	7	CYLD_phos_site is a natively unstructured region on a subset of tumour-suppressor and de-ubiquitinating enzyme CYLD proteins in eukaryotes. It lies between the second pair of CAP_GLY domains, Pfam:PF01302, on these proteins. This region of CYLD, being unstructured, carries a number of serine residues which, in response to cellular stimuli, become phosphorylated. This transient phosphorylation-state induces ubiquitination of TRAF2, a ubiquitin ligase that catalyses both self-ubiquitination and the ubiquitination of specific target molecules involved in signal transduction [1].

CNPase	PF05881.11	1	11	This family consists of the eukaryotic protein 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP). 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is one of the earliest myelin-related proteins expressed in differentiating oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. CNP is abundant in the central nervous system and in oligodendrocytes. This protein is also found in mammalian photoreceptor cells, testis and lymphocytes. Although the biological function of CNP is unknown, it is thought to play a significant role in the formation of the myelin sheath, where it comprises 4% of total protein. CNP selectively cleaves 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides in vitro. Although physiologically relevant substrates with 2',3'-cyclic termini are still unknown, numerous cyclic phosphate containing RNAs occur transiently within eukaryotic cells. Other known protein families capable of hydrolysing 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides include tRNA ligases and plant cyclic phosphodiesterases. The catalytic domains from all these proteins contain two tetra-peptide motifs H-X-T/S-X, where X is usually a hydrophobic residue. Mutation of either histidine in CNP abolishes enzymatic activity [1]. CNPases belong to the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily. They share a common active site, characterised by two conserved histidines, with the bacterial tRNA-ligating enzyme LigT, vertebrate myelin-associated 2',3' phosphodiesterases, plant Arabidopsis thaliana CPDases and several several bacteria and virus proteins [2].

MTBP_mid	PF14919.5	1	20	MTBP, or MDM2-binding protein, binds to MDM2. The MDM2 protein, through its interaction with p53, plays an important role in the regulation of the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle [1]. MTBP promotes MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and also MDM2 stabilisation in an MDM2 RING finger-dependent manner [2]. MTBP differentially regulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 towards two of its most critical targets (itself and p53) and in doing so significantly contributes to MDM2-dependent p53 homeostasis in unstressed cells [2]. MTBP inhibits cancer cell migration by interacting with a protein involved in cell motility. This motility protein is alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4) [3].

Together these form an N-shaped structure, with the loop allowing the two helices to assume a parallel orientation. The monomeric domains associate into a dimer through the formation of an antiparallel coiled coil between the alpha-2 helices and domain swapping of two alpha-1 helices, where one alpha-1 helix swings back and packs against the alpha-2 helix from the second monomer. Two dimers then associate into a tetramer. The oligomerisation domain is essential for the oncogenicity of the Bcr-Abl protein [1].

Member proteins are low-abundance proteins that colocalise with coilin in Cajal bodies. Peptidase_C98 depletion does not affect global sumoylation, but causes striking coilin mis-localisation and impairs cell proliferation, functions that are not dependent on the catalytic activity.

SGIII	PF15467.5	1	10	Secretogranin_3 is a family of vertebrate proteins that is one of the granin family. Granins are rich in acidic amino acids, exhibit aggregation at low pH, and possess a high capacity for calcium binding. Because granins are restricted in their localisation to secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, two interesting characteristics of their sorting mechanisms have been observed. These are, first, that they aggregate on low pH/high calcium concentrations and second that two of them carry an N-terminal disulfide loop, mutations in which lead to mis-sorting. Thus, granins are thought to be essential for the sorting of secretory proteins at the trans-Golgi network. Chromogranin A (CgA) binds to SGIII in secretory granules of endocrine cells [1].

SNAPc19	PF15497.5	1	31	SNAPc19 is a family of proteins found in eukaryotes. It is one of the five core components of the snRNA-activating protein complex or SNAPc that helps direct the nucleation of RNA polymerases II and III. The core RNA polymerase II snRNA promoters consist of a single essential element, the proximal sequence element (PSE), whereas the core RNA polymerase III snRNA promoters consist of both a PSE and a TATA box. The SNAPc binds to the PSE of both of these. SNAPc recognises the PSE sequence common to all human snRNA genes, irrespective of polymerase specificity. SNAPc is also known as the PSE transcription factor (PTF) or PSE-binding protein (PBP). The human SNAP19 and SNAP45 subunits are dispensable for transcription in vitro and are not as widely conserved as the other three, SNAP190, SNAP43 and SNAP50, suggesting that these vertebrate-specific SNAPc subunits may have adapted specialised regulatory roles for snRNA gene transcription [3].

Nrf1_activ_bdg	PF10492.8	1	5	In Drosophila, the erect wing (ewg) protein is required for proper development of the central nervous system and the indirect flight muscles. The fly ewg gene encodes a novel DNA-binding domain that is also found in four genes previously identified in sea urchin, chicken, zebrafish, and human [1]. Nuclear respiratory factor-1 is a transcriptional activator that has been implicated in the nuclear control of respiratory chain expression in vertebrates. The first 26 amino acids of nuclear respiratory factor-1 are required for the binding of dynein light chain. The interaction with dynein light chain is observed for both ewg and Nrf-1, transcription factors that are structurally and functionally similar between humans and Drosophila [2]. The highest level of expression of both ewg and Nrf-1 was found in the central nervous system, somites, first branchial arch, optic vesicle, and otic vesicle. In the mouse Nrf-1 protein, Swiss:Q8C4C0, there is an activation domain at 303-469, the most conserved part of which is this domain 446-469. Ewg is a site-specific transcriptional activator, and evolutionarily conserved regions of ewg contribute both positively and negatively to transcriptional activity [3]. The family Nrf1_DNA-bind is associated with this domain towards the N-terminal, as is the N terminal of the activation domain.

It is a proline-rich family that can be phosphorylated by AKT, and in the phosphorylated state binds to 14-3-3. The AKT signalling pathway contributes to regulation of apoptosis after a variety of cell death stimuli, and PRAS is found to be a substrate [1]. PRAS plays an important role in regulating cell survival downstream of the PI3-K/Akt pathway after re-perfusion injury after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Copper/zinc-SOD (SOD1), a cytosolic isoenzyme of superoxide dismutase, SOD, is highly protective against ischemia and re-perfusion injury after transient focal cerebral ischemia, and SOD1 thus contributes to the inhibition of direct oxidation of PRAS and the activation of its signalling pathway [2].

IL12p40_C	PF10420.8	1	40	IL12p40_C is the largely beta stranded C-terminal, D3, domain of interleukin-12p40 or interleukin-12B. This interleukin is produced on stimulation by macrophage-engulfed micro-organisms and other stimuli, when it dimerises with interleukin-12p35 to form a heterodimer which then binds to receptors on natural killer cells to activate them to destroy the micro-organisms [1]. This domain contains two disulfide bridges, one of which serves to bind p40 to p35 and the other to hold the beta strands within the domain together. The cupped shape of the p35 binding interface matches the elbow-like bend between D2 and D3 in p40 [2]. The domain is often associated with family fn3, Pfam:PF00041.

WD repeats may be involved in a range of biological functions including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. The C-terminal contains a proline-rich sequence (PPRLPQR), and is predicted to have leucine-rich coiled coil region (CC) [1]. WDCP was identified in a proteomic screen to find signalling components that interact with Hck (hematopoietic cell kinase), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. WDCP was shown to bind tightly and specifically to the SH3 domain of Hck in U937 human monocytic cells. WDCP was also shown to exist as an oligomer when expressed in mammalian cells. While the function of WDCP is unknown, it has been identified in a gene fusion event with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in colorectal cancer patients [1].

In the absence of KRIT1 ICAP1 binds via its C-terminal PH/PTB fold domain to the integrin beta-1 cytoplasmic tail. Binding of KRIT1 to ICAP1 via NUDIX_5 out-competes the binding of ICAP1 to integrin cytoplasmic tails such that ICAP1 is sequestered in the nucleus. Integrin activation is thus prevented [1].

ICAP-1_inte_bdg	PF10480.8	1	2	ICAP-1 is a serine/threonine-rich protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of beta-1 integrins in a highly specific manner, binding to a NPXY sequence motif on the beta-1 integrin. The cytoplasmic domains of integrins are essential for cell adhesion, and the fact that phosphorylation of ICAP-1 by interaction with the cell-matrix implies an important role of ICAP-1 during integrin-dependent cell adhesion [1]. Overexpression of ICAP-1 strongly reduces the integrin-mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix and inhibits both Cdc42 and Rac1. In addition, ICAP-1 induces release of Cdc42 from cellular membranes and prevents the dissociation of GDP from this GTPase [2]. An additional function of ICAP-1 is to promote differentiation of osteoprogenitors by supporting their condensation through modulating the integrin high affinity state [3],	ICAP-1_inte_bdg	Family	102	165.2	57	78.45	Changed	Beta-1 integrin binding protein	4DX9;4JIF;4DX8	0.2139040918	198	-32.8	-19.8547215496

The protein exists as a homodimer, with each monomer being composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain featured in this family is organised into a thioredoxin-like fold that resembles the a domain of human protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) [2]. However, this domain lacks the C-X-X-C motif required for the redox function of PDI; it is therefore thought that ERp29's function is similar to the chaperone function of PDI [2]. The N-terminal domain is exclusively responsible for the homodimerisation of the protein, without covalent linkages or additional contacts with other domains [2].

This mechanism monitors the proper bipolar attachment of sister chromatids to spindle microtubules and ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. A key player in mitosis is Mad2, and Mad2 exhibits an unusual two-state behaviour. A Mad1-Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic Mad2 to kinetochores through Mad2 dimerisation and converts Mad2 to a conformer amenable to Cdc20 binding. p31comet inactivates the checkpoint by binding to Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2 in such a way as to stop Mad2 activation and to promote the dissociation of the Mad2-Cdc20 complex [1].	p31comet	Family	103	226.4	38	83.71	Changed	Mad1 and Cdc20-bound-Mad2 binding	2QYF	0.3433739291	254	-27.6	-12.1908127208

MKRN1 plays an important role in modulating the homeostasis of telomere-length through a dynamic balance involving the stability of the protein hTERT [2]. MKRN1 has been shown to be a a transcriptional co-regulator and an E3 ligase. It functions simultaneously as a differentially negative regulator of p53 and p21, preferentially leading cells to p53-dependent apoptosis by suppressing p21 [3]. The exact function of the C-terminal region has not been determined.	MKRN1_C	Domain	110	76.7	56	16.91	Changed	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase makorin-1, C-terminal		0.7457869057	81	-4.3	-5.6062581486

GSAP-16	PF14959.5	1	26	GSAP, or gamma-secretase-activating protein, also known as PION, regulates gamma-secretase activity. The holo-protein is a large, approx 850 residue protein that is rapidly cleaved to an active 16 kDa C-terminal fragment that is the stable, predominant form. GSAP is expressed in inclusion bodies and is important in brain function. It dramatically and selectively increases neurotoxic beta-Amyloid production in the brain through a mechanism involving its interactions with both gamma-secretase and its substrate, the amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). Accumulation of neurotoxic beta-Amyloid is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Formation of beta-Amyloid is catalysed by gamma-secretase, a protease with numerous substrates that catalyses the intra-membrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) [1]. The secondary structure of GSAP is largely alpha-helical, lacking well-defined tertiary structure. GSAP represents a type of gamma-secretase regulator that directs enzyme specificity by interacting with a specific substrate [2].

MMS22L complexes with TONSL and this complex accumulates at regions of ssDNA associated with distressed replication forks or at processed DNA breaks. Its depletion results in high levels of endogenous DNA double-strand breaks caused by an inability to complete DNA synthesis after replication fork collapse [1]. Thus the complex mediates recovery from replication stress and homologous recombination in vertebrates, yeasts and plants [2,3]. This family is the more C-terminal region of the proteins.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays multiple roles in vertebrate species. In mammals, it is the major hypothalamic releasing factor for pituitary adrenocorticotropin secretion, and is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at other sites in the central nervous system. In non-mammalian vertebrates, CRH not only acts as a neurotransmitter and hypophysiotropin, it also acts as a potent thyrotropin-releasing factor, allowing CRH to regulate both the adrenal and thyroid axes, especially in development. CRH-BP is thought to play an inhibitory role in which it binds CRH and other CRH-like ligands and prevents the activation of CRH receptors. There is however evidence that CRH-BP may also exhibit diverse extra and intracellular roles in a cell specific fashion and at specific times in development [1].

It formsa selenosulfide bond between cys 174 and Sec 188, that has a redox potential -234 mV. In vitro, SelS is an efficient reductase that depends on the presence of selenocysteine. Due to the high reactivity, SelS also has peroxidase activity that can catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide [2]. It is also resistant to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide which might provide evolutionary advantage compared to cysteine containing peroxidases [3].

SelP_N	PF04592.13	1	11	SelP is the only known eukaryotic selenoprotein that contains multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues, and accounts for more than 50% of the selenium content of rat and human plasma [1]. It is thought to be glycosylated [2]. SelP may have antioxidant properties. It can attach to epithelial cells, and may protect vascular endothelial cells against peroxynitrite toxicity [1]. The high selenium content of SelP suggests that it may be involved in selenium intercellular transport or storage [2]. The promoter structure of bovine SelP suggest that it may be involved in countering heavy metal intoxication, and may also have a developmental function [3]. The N-terminal region of SelP can exist independently of the C terminal region. Zebrafish selenoprotein Pb (Swiss:Q98SV0) lacks the C terminal Sec-rich region, and a protein encoded by the rat SelP gene and lacking this region has also been reported [2]. N-terminal region contains a conserved SecxxCys motif, which is similar to the CysxxCys found in thioredoxins. It is speculated that the N terminal region may adopt a thioredoxin fold and catalyse redox reactions [2]. The N-terminal region also contains a His-rich region, which is thought to mediate heparin binding. Binding to heparan proteoglycans could account for the membrane binding properties of SelP [1]. The function of the bacterial members of this family is uncharacterised.	SelP_N	Family	116	173.7	28	57.39	Changed	Selenoprotein P, N terminal region		0.9351138532	216	-42.3	-24.3523316062

BBIP10	PF14777.5	1	9	The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of the all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme [1]. BBIP10 localises to the primary cilium, and is present exclusively in ciliated organisms. It is required for cytoplasmic microtubule polymerisation and acetylation, two functions not shared with any other BBSome subunits. BBIP10 physically interacts with HDAC6. BBSome-bound BBIP10 may therefore function to couple acetylation of axonemal microtubules and ciliary membrane growth [2]. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialised for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction [3].

Siva	PF05458.11	1	4	Siva binds to the CD27 cytoplasmic tail. It has a DD homology region, a box-B-like ring finger, and a zinc finger-like domain. Overexpression of Siva in various cell lines induces apoptosis, suggesting an important role for Siva in the CD27-transduced apoptotic pathway [1]. Siva-1 binds to and inhibits BCL-X(L)-mediated protection against UV radiation-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the unique amphipathic helical region (SAH) present in Siva-1 is required for its binding to BCL-X(L) and sensitising cells to UV radiation. Natural complexes of Siva-1/BCL-X(L) are detected in HUT78 and murine thymocyte, suggesting a potential role for Siva-1 in regulating T cell homeostasis [2]. This family contains both Siva-1 and the shorter Siva-2 lacking the sequence coded by exon 2. It has been suggested that Siva-2 could regulate the function of Siva-1 [3].

CPG4	PF15481.5	1	20	CPG4 is a domain family found in nematodes of one of nine core chondroitin proteoglycans. Vertebrates produce multiple chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that play important roles in development and tissue mechanics. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the chondroitin chains lack sulfate but nevertheless play essential roles in embryonic development and vulval morphogenesis. CPG4 has the largest predicted mass of the C. elegans CPGs at 84 kDa. The majority of its 35 predicted glycosaminoglycan attachment sites reside in the COOH-terminal half of the protein, of which four sites were confirmed by DTT modification [1]. The family is rich in conserved cysteines.	CPG4	Family	128	90.9	22	27.84	Changed	Chondroitin proteoglycan 4		1.3362683706	90	0.9	0.9900990099

Radiologically, it is characterised by a generalised hyperostosis and sclerosis leading to a markedly thickened and sclerotic skull, with mandible, ribs, clavicles and all long bones also being affected. Due to narrowing of the foramina of the cranial nerves, facial nerve palsy, hearing loss and atrophy of the optic nerves can occur. Sclerosteosis is clinically and radiologically very similar to van Buchem disease, mainly differentiated by hand malformations and a large stature in sclerosteosis patients [1].

Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function [3]. Med29, along with Med11 and Med28, in mammals, is part of the core head-region of the complex. Med29 is the apparent orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster Intersex protein, which interacts directly with, and functions as a transcriptional coactivator for, the DNA-binding transcription factor Doublesex, so it is likely that mammalian Med29 serves as a target for one or more DNA-binding transcriptional activators [4].

CNDH2_M	PF16869.4	1	15	CNDH2_M is the middle domain of the H2 subunit of the condensin II complex, found in eukaryotes but not fungi. Eukaryotes carry at least two condensin complexes, I and II, each made up of five subunits. The functions of the two complexes are collaborative but non-overlapping. CI appears to be functional in G2 phase in the cytoplasm beginning the process of chromosomal lateral compaction while the CII are concentrated in the nucleus, possibly to counteract the activity of cohesion at this stage. In prophase, CII contributes to axial shortening of chromatids while CI continues to bring about lateral chromatid compaction, during which time the sister chromatids are joined centrally by cohesins. There appears to be just one condensin complex in fungi. CI and CII each contain SMC2 and SMC4 (structural maintenance of chromosomes) subunits, then CI has non-SMC CAP-D2 (CND1), CAP-G (CND3), and CAP-H (CND2). CII has, in addition to the two SMCs, CAP-D3, CAPG2 and CAP-H2. All four of the CAP-D and CAP-G subunits have degenerate HEAT repeats, whereas the CAP-H are kleisins or SMC-interacting proteins (ie they bind directly to the SMC subunits in the complex). The SMC molecules are each long with a small hinge-like knob at the free end of a longish strand, articulating with each other at the hinge. Each strand ends in a knob-like head that binds to one or other end of the CAP-H subunit. The HEAT-repeat containing D and G subunits bind side-by-side between the ends of the H subunit. Activity of the various parts of the complex seem to be triggered by extensive phosphorylations, eg, entry of the complex, in Sch.pombe, into the nucleus during mitosis is promoted by Cdk1 phosphorylation of SMC4/Cut3; and it has been shown that Cdk1 phosphorylates CAP-D3 at Thr1415 in He-La cells thus promoting early stage chromosomal condensation by CII [1,2]. This region represents the disordered section of CNDH2 between the N- and the C-termini.	CNDH2_M	Family	133	140.4	25	23.24	Changed	PF16858		1.0548320793	96	44.4	31.6239316239

CtIP_N	PF10482.8	1	22	CtIP is predominantly a nuclear protein that complexes with both BRCA1 and the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1). At the protein level, CtIP expression varies with cell cycle progression in a pattern identical to that of BRCA1. Thus, the steady-state levels of CtIP polypeptides, which remain low in resting cells and G1 cycling cells, increase dramatically as Dividing cells traverse the G1/S boundary. CtIP can potentially modulate the functions ascribed to BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and/or cell cycle checkpoint control [2]. This N-terminal domain carries a coiled-coil region and is essential for homodimerisation of the protein [3]. The C-terminal domain is family Pfam:PF08573.

There is a conserved HGRHFT sequence motif. This family is the C terminal domain of the Suppressor of Fused protein (Su(fu)). Su(fu) is a repressor of the Gli and Ci transcription factors of the Hedgehog signalling cascade. It functions by binding these proteins and preventing their translocation to the nucleus. The C terminal domain is only found in eukaryotic Su(fu) proteins; it is not present in bacterial homologues. The C terminal domain binds to the N terminal of Gli/Ci while the N terminal of Su(fu) binds to the C terminal of Gli/Ci.

CCDC134 is widely expressed in normal adult tissues, tumour tissues and cell lines, which shows its importance in cell signal transduction pathways, transcription regulation and therefore cell survival [1]. Additionally, CCDC134 is known to bind to a transcription adaptor, hADA2a, which forms part of the general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5) histone acetyltransferase complex. Acetylation usually 'switches genes on' for transcription. Moreover, knocking out CCDC134 suppressed hADA2a-induced cell apoptosis activity and G1/S cell cycle arrest suggesting its importance in cell survival [2].

The Homer proteins form a physical tether linking mGluRs with the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) that appears to be due to the proline-rich Homer ligand (PPXXFr). Activation of PI turnover triggers intracellular calcium release [1]. MGluR function is altered in the mouse model of human Fragile X syndrome mental retardation, a disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the Fragile X mental retardation gene Fmr1. Homer 3 (and to a lesser extent Homer 1b/c) has been shown to form a multimeric complex with mGlu1a and the IP3 receptor, indicating that Homers may play a role in the localisation of receptors to their signalling partners [2].

TPP1	PF10341.8	1	45	TPP1 is a component of the telomerase holoenzyme, involved in telomere replication. It has been demonstrated that TPP1 dimerises and binds to DNA and RNA. Furthermore, TPP1 stimulates the dissociation of RNA/DNA hetero-duplexes [1,2]. Yeast telomerase protein TPP1 (Est3 in yeast) is a novel type of GTPase [3]. The key residues in Swiss:Q03096 are an Asp at residue 86 and the Arg at residue 110. The Asp is totally conserved in the family, whereas the Arg is not so well conserved. The N-terminal of TPP1 is likely to be the binding surface for TINF2, whereas the C-terminus probably binds to POT1, thereby tethering POT1 to the shelterin complex [4]. The complex bound to telomeric DNA increases the activity and processivity of the human telomerase core enzyme, thus helping to maintain the length of the telomeres [5,6]. This domain is conserved from fungi to mammals, hence family Telomere_Pot1 has been merged into the family [7]. The human shelterin complex includes six proteins: telomere repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), TRF2, repressor/activator protein 1 (RAP1), TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2 (TIN2), TIN2-interacting protein 1 (TPP1) and protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) [8].

However, proteins have now been identified as being integrally involved in neuronal function and morphogenesis. The family is involved in both the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the recruitment of the downstream effector WAVE complex to the close vicinity of PI3K; it also appears to regulate the brain size and neurite outgrowth in mice [2].

TIM22 complex imports and inserts multi-pass trans-membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane by formation of a twin-pore translocase with components in the outer and inner membranes. TIM29 is integrated into the inner member with the C terminus exposed to the inter-membrane space and able to contact the translocase of the outer membrane. It is required for complex stability and for the addition of the TIMM22 protein to the complex [1].

KCNQC3-Ank-G_bd	PF11956.7	1	12	Interactions with ankyrin-G are crucial to the localisation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at the axon initial segment and for neurons to initiate action potentials. This conserved 9-amino acid motif ((V/A)P(I/L)AXXE(S/D)D) is required for ankyrin-G binding and functions to localise sodium channels to a variety of 'excitable' membrane domains both inside and outside of the nervous system [1]. This motif has also been identified in the potassium channel 6TM proteins KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 [2], that correspond to the M channels that exert a crucial influence over neuronal excitability. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels are preferentially localised to the surface of axons both at the axonal initial segment and more distally, and this axonal initial segment targeting of surface KCNQ channels is mediated by these ankyrin-G binding motifs of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 [3]. KCNQ3 is a major determinant of M channel localisation to the AIS, rather than KCNQ2 [4]. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that anchor motifs evolved sequentially in chordates (NaV channel) and jawed vertebrates (KCNQ2/3) [5].

Med28	PF11594.7	1	6	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species [1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function [3]. Subunit Med28 of the Mediator may function as a scaffolding protein within Mediator by maintaining the stability of a submodule within the head module, and components of this submodule act together in a gene-regulatory programme to suppress smooth muscle cell differentiation. Thus, mammalian Mediator subunit Med28 functions as a repressor of smooth muscle-cell differentiation, which could have implications for disorders associated with abnormalities in smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation, including atherosclerosis, asthma, hypertension, and smooth muscle tumours [4].

C9orf72-like	PF15019.5	1	24	The precise function of this family is unknown but members have been found to be localised in the cytoplasm of brain tissue. Defects in the gene, C9orf72, are the cause of frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTDALS) which is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. The disorder is caused by a large expansion of a GGGGCC hexa-nucleotide within the first C9orf72 intron located between the first and the second non-coding exons.

ADAM17_MPD	PF16698.4	1	30	ADAM17_MPD is the membrane-proximal domain of a family of disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 found in metazoan species. ADAM17 is a major sheddase that is responsible for the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, such as cellular differentiation, regeneration, and cancer progression. This MPD region acts as the sheddase switch. PDI or protein-disulfide isomerase interacts with ADAM17 and to down-regulate its enzymatic activity. The interaction is directly with the MPD, the region of dimerisation and substrate recognition, where it catalyses an isomerisation of disulfide bridges within the thioredoxin motif CXXC. this isomerisation results in a major structural change between an active, open state and an inactive, closed state of the MPD. This change is thought to act as a molecular switch, allowing a global reorientation of the extracellular domains in ADAM17 and regulating its shedding activity [1].

Rod_C	PF10493.8	1	18	Rod, the Rough deal protein, displays a dynamic intracellular staining pattern, localising first to kinetochores in pro-metaphase, but moving to kinetochore microtubules at metaphase. Early in anaphase the protein is once again restricted to the kinetochores, where it persists until the end of telophase. This behaviour is in all respects similar to that described for ZW10 [1], and indeed the two proteins function together, localisation of each depending upon the other [2]. These two proteins are found at the kinetochore in complex with a third, Zwilch, in both flies and humans. The C-terminus is the most conserved part of the protein. During pro-metaphase, the ZW10-Rod complex, dynein/dynactin, and Mad2 all accumulate on unattached kinetochores; microtubule capture leads to Mad2 depletion as it is carried off by dynein/dynactin; ZW10-Rod complex accumulation continues, replenishing kinetochore dynein. The continuing recruitment of the ZW10-Rod complex during metaphase may serve to maintain adequate dynein/dynactin complex on kinetochores for assisting chromatid movement during anaphase[2]. The ZW10-Rod complex acts as a bridge whose association with Zwint-1 links Mad1 and Mad2, components that are directly responsible for generating the diffusible 'wait anaphase' signal, to a structural, inner kinetochore complex containing Mis12 and KNL-1AF15q14, the last of which has been proved to be essential for kinetochore assembly in C. elegans.

Maelstrom	PF13017.5	1	21	Maelstrom is a germ-plasm component protein, that is shown to be functionally involved in the piRNA pathway. It is conserved throughout Eukaryota, though it appears to have been lost from all examined teleost fish species. The domain architecture shows that it is coupled with several DNA- and RNA- related domains such as HMG box, SR-25-like and HDAC_interact domains. Sequence analysis and fold recognition have found a distant similarity between Maelstrom domain and the DnaQ 3'-5' exonuclease family with the RNase H fold (Exonuc_X-T, Pfam:PF00929); notably, that the Maelstrom domains from basal eukaryotes contain the conserved 3'-5' exonuclease active site residues (Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp, DEDHD). However, the animal and some amoeba maelstrom contain another set of conserved residues (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys, EHHCHC). This evolutionary link together with structural examinations leads to the hypothesis that Maelstrom domains may have a potential nuclease-transposase activity or RNA-binding ability that may be implicated in piRNA biogenesis. A protein function evolution mode, namely active site switch, has been proposed [1], in which the amoeba Maelstrom domains are the possible evolutionary intermediates due to their harbouring of the specific characteristics of both 3'-5' exonuclease and Maelstrom domains.

The precise function of the all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme [1]. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialised for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction [3]. BBS2 is one of the three Bardet-Biedl syndrome subunits that is required for leptin receptor signalling in the hypothalamus, and BBS2 and 4 are also required for the localisation of somatostatin receptor 3 and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 into neuronal cilia [5].

Nrf1_DNA-bind	PF10491.8	1	15	In Drosophila, the erect wing (ewg) protein is required for proper development of the central nervous system and the indirect flight muscles. The fly ewg gene encodes a novel DNA-binding domain that is also found in four genes previously identified in sea urchin, chicken, zebrafish, and human [1]. Nuclear respiratory factor-1 is a transcriptional activator that has been implicated in the nuclear control of respiratory chain expression in vertebrates. The first 26 amino acids of nuclear respiratory factor-1 are required for the binding of dynein light chain. The interaction with dynein light chain is observed for both ewg and Nrf-1, transcription factors that are structurally and functionally similar between humans and Drosophila [2]. The highest level of expression of both ewg and Nrf-1 was found in the central nervous system, somites, first branchial arch, optic vesicle, and otic vesicle. In the mouse Nrf-1 protein, Swiss-Prot:Q8C4C0, there is also an NLS domain at 88-116, and a DNA binding and dimerisation domain at 127-282. Ewg is a site-specific transcriptional activator, and evolutionarily conserved regions of ewg contribute both positively and negatively to transcriptional activity [3].

This domain is found FAP206 Swiss:Q23H79, a protein associated with cilia and flagella. In the ciliate Tetrahymena, the cilium has radial spokes, each of which is a macromolecular complex essential for motility. A triplet of three radial spokes, RS1, RS2, and RS3, is repeated every 96 nm along the doublet microtubule. Each spoke has a distinct base that docks to the doublet and is linked to different inner dynein arms. Knockout of the FAP206 gene results in slow cell motility and the 96-nm repeats lack RS2 and dynein c. FAP206 is probably part of the front prong and docks RS2 and dynein c to the microtubule [1].

BBS2_Mid	PF14783.5	1	20	The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of the all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme [1]. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialised for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction [3]. BBS2 is one of the three Bardet-Biedl syndrome subunits that is required for leptin receptor signalling in the hypothalamus, and BBS2 and 4 are also required for the localisation of somatostatin receptor 3 and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 into neuronal cilia [5].

LIN52	PF10044.8	1	32	LIN52 is a family of proteins of approximately 112 amino acids in length which is conserved from nematodes to humans. The proposed tertiary structure is of almost entirely alpha helix interrupted only by loops located at proline residues. Three sites in the protein sequence reveal two types of possible post-translation modification. A serine residue, at position 41, is a candidate for protein kinase C phosphorylation. Glycine residues at position 69 and 91 are probable sites for acetylation by covalent amide linkage of myristate via N-myristoyl transferase. LIN52 is differentially expressed in the trout retina between parr and smolt developmental stages (smoltification). It is likely to be a house-keeping protein [1]. LIN52 forms a complex (LINC) required for transcriptional activation of G2/M genes. The LINC core complex consists of at least five subunits including the chromatin-associated LIN-9 and RbAp48 proteins [2,3]. LINC associates with a large number of E2F-regulated promoters in quiescent cells [2]. Family members are required for spermatogenesis by repressing testis-specific gene expression [4].

FIIND	PF13553.5	1	40	The function to find (FIIND) was initially discovered in two proteins, NLRP1 (aka NALP1, CARD7, NAC, DEFCAP) and CARD8 (aka TUCAN, Cardinal) [1]. NLRP1 is a member of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein superfamily and is involved in apoptosis and inflammation. To date, it is the only NLR protein known to have a FIIND domain. The FIIND domain is also present in the CARD8 protein where, like in NLRP1, it is followed by a C-terminal CARD domain. Both proteins are described to form an inflammasome, a macro-molecular complex able to process caspase 1 and activate pro-IL1beta [2]. The FIIND domain is present in only a very small subset of the kingdom of life, comprising primates, rodents (mouse, rat), carnivores (dog) and a few more, such as horse. The function of this domain is yet to be determined. Publications describing the newly discovered NLRP1 protein failed to identify it as a separate domain; for example, it was taken as part of the adjacent leucine rich repeat domain (LRR) [3]. Upon discovery of CARD8 it was noted that the N-terminal region shared significant sequence identity with an undescribed region in NLRP1 [1]. Before getting its final name, FIIND [4], this domain was termed NALP1-associated domain (NAD) [5].	FIIND	Family	187	218.5	29	30.12	Changed	Function to find		0.7084345647	240	-21.5	-9.8398169336

Ins_allergen_rp	PF06757.12	1	85	This family exemplifies a case of novel gene evolution. The case in point is the arms-race between plants and their infective insective herbivores in the area of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system. Brassicas have developed the glucosinolate-myrosinase system as chemical defence mechanism against the insects, and consequently the insects have adapted to produce a detoxifying molecule, nitrile-specifier protein (NSP). NSP is present in the small white butterfly Pieris rapae. NSP is structurally different from and has no amino acid homology to any known detoxifying enzymes, and it appears to have arisen by a process of domain and gene duplication of a sequence of unknown function that is widespread in insect species and referred to as insect-allergen-repeat protein. Thus this family is found either as a single domain or as a multiple repeat-domain [3].

DARPP-32	PF05395.11	1	9	This family consists of several mammalian protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (IPP-1) and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) proteins. Protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 is involved in signal transduction and is an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 [1]. It has been demonstrated that DARPP-32, if phosphorylated, can inhibit protein-phosphatase-1 [2]. DARPP-32 has a key role in many neurotransmitter pathways throughout the brain and has been shown to be involved in controlling receptors, ion channels and other physiological factors including the brain's response to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, opiates and nicotine. DARPP-32 is reciprocally regulated by the two neurotransmitters that are most often implicated in schizophrenia - dopamine and glutamate. Dopamine activates DARPP-32 through the D1 receptor pathway and disables DARPP-32 through the D2 receptor. Glutamate, acting through the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, renders DARPP-32 inactive [3]. A mutant form of DARPP-32 has been linked with gastric cancers [4].	DARPP-32	Family	192	127.4	37	86.92	Changed	Protein phosphatase inhibitor 1/DARPP-32		0.7941981074	131	-3.6	-2.8257456829

betaPIX_CC	PF16523.4	1	19	betaPIX_CC is the very C-terminal coiled-coil region of betaPIX or p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor proteins. The coiled-coil runs from residues 589-646 in UniProtKB:G31IU6, and the PDZ-binding site is the final eight residues immediately downstream. The coiled-coil trimerises and thus exposes three potential PZD-binding surfaces, although only one of these is maximally used. One of the C-terminal ends of the coiled-coil forms an extensive beta-sheet interaction with the Shank PDZ, while the other two ends are not involved in ligand binding and form random coils. Thus the coiled-coil domain allows multimerisation of betaPIX that is vital for its physiological functions. betaPIX and the Shank/ProSAP protein form a complex that acts as a protein scaffold for integrating signalling pathways and regulating postsynaptic structure [1].** Forced reload	betaPIX_CC	Coiled-coil	201	85.3	59	12.34	Changed	betaPIX coiled coil	3L4F;2W6B	0.6873439874	87	-1.7	-1.9929660023

DAG1	PF05454.10	1	4	Dystroglycan is one of the dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, which is encoded by a 5.5 kb transcript in human. The protein product is cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits, [alpha] (N-terminal) and [beta] (C-terminal). In skeletal muscle the dystroglycan complex works as a transmembrane linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. [alpha]-dystroglycan is extracellular and binds to merosin ([alpha]-2 laminin) in the basement membrane, while [beta]-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein and binds to dystrophin, which is a large rod-like cytoskeletal protein, absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Dystrophin binds to intracellular actin cables. In this way, the dystroglycan complex, which links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cables, is thought to provide structural integrity in muscle tissues. The dystroglycan complex is also known to serve as an agrin receptor in muscle, where it may regulate agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering at the neuromuscular junction. There is also evidence which suggests the function of dystroglycan as a part of the signal transduction pathway because it is shown that Grb2, a mediator of the Ras-related signal pathway, can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of dystroglycan. In general, aberrant expression of dystrophin-associated protein complex underlies the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy and severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, no genetic disease has been described for either [alpha]- or [beta]-dystroglycan. Dystroglycan is widely distributed in non-muscle tissues as well as in muscle tissues. During epithelial morphogenesis of kidney, the dystroglycan complex is shown to act as a receptor for the basement membrane. Dystroglycan expression in mouse brain and neural retina has also been reported. However, the physiological role of dystroglycan in non-muscle tissues has remained unclear [1].

The precise function of the all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme [1]. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialised for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction [3]. BBS1 predominantly localizes to the basal body and or transitional zone of ciliated cells. It has been found in a heptameric complex with BBS2, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9, termed the BBSome.

Myosin-VI_CBD	PF16521.4	1	26	Myosin-VI_CBD is a C-terminal family that allows unconventional myosin-VI to recognise and select its binding cargoes. Several adaptor proteins have been reported to interact specifically with the CBD, thus defining the specific subcellular functions of myosin VI. The crystal structure determination of the myosin VI CBD/Dab2 (an endocytic adaptor protein Disabled-2 that is a cargo) complex shows that the Myosin-VI_CBD forms a cargo-induced dimer, suggesting that the motor undergoes monomer-to-dimer conversion that is dependent upon cargo binding. In the absence of cargo myosin VI exists as a stable monomer. This cargo binding-mediated monomer-to-dimer conversion mechanism adopted by myosin VI may be shared by other unconventional myosins, such as myosin VII and myosin X [1].

The proteins display a highly conserved predicted N-terminal coiled-coil domain and an invariant sequence matching a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation consensus sequence (RKXS) [1]. The coiled-coil structure interacts with the bZIP domain of CREB [2]. This interaction may occur via ionic bonds because it is disrupted under high-salt conditions [3]. In addition to CREB-binding, the N-terminal region plays a role in the tetramer formation of TORCs [2], but the physiological function of the multimeric complex has not been clarified yet.

Due to its mechanism, PAT1 activity increases at acidic pH, which correlates well with the acidic micro-climate close to the brush-border in the intestine. Glycine, proline, and alanine are the preferred substrates of the transporter. The maximum velocity is similar for the three substrates. All substrates are transported with low affinity, showing Km values in the range of 2-10 mM. The transporter does not discriminate between L- and D-isoforms of these amino acids; in addition, beta-alanine is transported with similar affinity as alpha-alanine. Similar to the IMINO transporter, the amino acid analog MeAIB is recognized by PAT1. The transporter is strongly expressed in the small intestine, colon, kidney, and brain.

They are Golgi-localized proteins that can interact with CesAs (cellulose synthase A) and control cellulose quantity. In the absence of STELLO function, the spatial distribution within the Golgi, secretion and activity of the CSCs are impaired indicating a central role of the STELLO proteins in CSC assembly. Point mutations in the predicted catalytic domains of the STELLO proteins indicate that they are glycosyltransferases facing the Golgi lumen.

IFT20	PF14931.5	1	48	IFT20 is subunit 20 of the intraflagellar transport complex B [1]. The intraflagellar transport complex assembles and maintains eukaryotic cilia and flagella. IFT20 is localised to the Golgi complex and is anchored there by the Golgi polypeptide, GMAP210, whereas all other subunits except IFT172 localise to cilia and the peri-basal body or centrosomal region at the base of cilia [1,2,3]. IFT20 accompanies Golgi-derived vesicles to the point of exocytosis near the basal bodies where the other IFT polypeptides are present, and where the intact IFT particle is assembled in association with the inner surface of the cell membrane. Passage of the IFT complex then follows, through the flagellar pore recognition site at the transition region, into the ciliary compartment. There also appears to be a role of intraflagellar transport (IFT) polypeptides in the formation of the immune synapse in non ciliated cells. The flagellum, in addition to being a sensory and motile organelle, is also a secretory organelle [5]. A number of IFT components are expressed in haematopoietic cells, which have no cilia, indicating an unexpected role of IFT proteins in immune synapse-assembly and intracellular membrane trafficking in T lymphocytes; this suggests that the immune synapse could represent the functional homologue of the primary cilium in these cells [6,7].

BBS2_C	PF14782.5	1	41	The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of the all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme [1]. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialised for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction [3]. BBS2 is one of the three Bardet-Biedl syndrome subunits that is required for leptin receptor signalling in the hypothalamus, and BBS2 and 4 are also required for the localisation of somatostatin receptor 3 and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 into neuronal cilia [5].

Whereas a standard HEAT repeat is composed of ~50 residues, the BLM10 HEAT repeats are highly variable. The length of helices ranges from 8 to 35 residues, turns range from 2 to 87 residues, and linkers range from 1 to 88 residues, with the longest linker, between HR21 and HR22, containing additional secondary structures (two strands and three helices). BLM10_N is the N-terminal ordered region of the three in BLM10. BLM10 is found to surround the proteasome entry pore in the 1.2 MDa complex of proteasome and BLM10 to form a largely closed dome that is expected to restrict access of potential substrates. BLM10 and PA200 are predominantly nuclear and stimulate the degradation of model peptides, although they do not appear to stimulate the degradation of proteins, recognise ubiquitin, or utilise ATP [2].

This region is found to be the residues that interact with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). KRAP was first localised as a membrane-bound form with extracellular regions suggesting it might be involved in the regulation of filamentous actin and signals from the outside of the cells [1]. It has now been shown to be critical for the proper subcellular localisation and function of IP3R. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor functions as the Ca2+ release channel on specialised endoplasmic reticulum membranes, so the subcellular localisation of IP3R is crucial for its proper function [2].

CENP-Q	PF13094.5	1	84	CENP-Q is one of the components that assembles onto the CENPA-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere. The centromere, which is the basic element of chromosome inheritance, is epigenetically determined in mammals. CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, assembles an array of nucleosomes and it is this that seems to be the prime candidate for specifying centromere identity. CENPA nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENPA-nucleosome-associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T, CENP-U(50), CENP-C and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENPA NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Additionally, there are seven other subunits which make up the CENPA-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere, CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S, also assembling on the CENP-A NAC [2].

Med25	PF11232.7	1	23	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species [1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-active part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function [4]. The overall function of the full-length Med25 is efficiently to coordinate the transcriptional activation of RAR/RXR (retinoic acid receptor/retinoic X receptor) in higher eukaryotic cells. Human Med25 consists of several domains with different binding properties, the N-terminal, VWA domain, an SD1 - synapsin 1 - domain from residues 229-381, a PTOV(B) or ACID domain from 395-545, an SD2 domain from residues 564-645 and a C-terminal NR box-containing domain (646-650) from 646-747. This family is the combined PTOV and SD2 domains. the PTOV domain being the domain through which Med25 co-operates with the histone acetyltransferase CBP, but the function of the SD2 domain is unclear [3].

The protein that contains this domain functions as a ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitination is required to direct proteins towards the proteasome for degradation. This protein is part of the WD40 class of F box proteins. The D domain of these F box proteins is involved in mediating the dimerisation of the protein. Dimerisation is necessary to polyubiquitinate substrates so this D domain is vital in directing substrates towards the proteasome for degradation.

Phtf proteins do not display any sequence similarity to known or predicted proteins, but their conservation among species suggests an essential function. The 84 kDa Phtf1 protein is an integral membrane protein, anchored to a cell membrane by six to eight trans-membrane domains, that is associated with a domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) juxtaposed to the Golgi apparatus. It is present during meiosis and spermiogenesis, and, by the end of spermiogenesis, is released from the mature spermatozoon within the residual bodies [1]. Phtf1 enhances the binding of FEM1B -feminisation homologue 1B - to cell membranes. Fem-1 was initially identified in the signaling pathway for sex determination, as well as being implicated in apoptosis, but its biochemical role is still unclear, and neither FEM1B nor PHTF1 is directly implicated in apoptosis in spermatogenesis.

SVWC	PF15430.5	1	85	SVWC is a family of single-domain von Willebrand factor type C proteins from lower eukaryotes. The canonical pattern of most von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domains is of ten cysteines, however this family, largely but not exclusively of arthropod proteins, contains only eight. SVWC family proteins respond to environmental challenges, such as bacterial infection and nutritional status. They also are involved in anti-viral immunity, and all of these functions seem linked to SVWC expression being induced by Dicer2.

Dysbindin	PF04440.15	1	15	Dysbindin is an evolutionary conserved 40-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein that binds to alpha- and beta-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain. Dystrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin are co-immunoprecipitated with dysbindin, indicating that dysbindin is DPC-associated in muscle. Dysbindin co-localises with alpha-dystrobrevin at the sarcolemma and is up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle. In the brain, dysbindin is found primarily in axon bundles and especially in certain axon terminals, notably mossy fibre synaptic terminals in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Dysbindin may have implications for the molecular pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may provide an alternative route for anchoring dystrobrevin and the DPC to the muscle membrane [1]. Genetic variation in the human dysbindin gene is also thought to be associated with Schizophrenia [2].

MRVI1	PF05781.11	1	9	This family consists of mammalian MRVI1 proteins which are related to the lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (JAW1) and the IP3 receptor associated cGMP kinase substrates A and B (IRAGA and IRAGB). The function of MRVI1 is unknown although mutations in the Mrvi1 gene induces myeloid leukaemia by altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation so it has been speculated that Mrvi1 is a tumour suppressor gene [1]. IRAG is very similar in sequence to MRVI1 and is an essential NO/cGKI-dependent regulator of IP3-induced calcium release. Activation of cGKI decreases IP3-stimulated elevations in intracellular calcium, induces smooth muscle relaxation and contributes to the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of NO/cGMP [2]. Jaw1 is a member of a class of proteins with COOH-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchors and is structurally similar to proteins involved in vesicle targeting and fusion. This suggests that the function and/or the structure of the ER in lymphocytes may be modified by lymphoid-restricted resident ER proteins [3].

This region is predicted to be a large extra-cellular domain of the NMDA receptor proteins, being highly hydrophilic, and is thought to be integrally involved in the function of the receptor. The region also carries a number of potential N-glycosylation sites [1].

EIF4E-T	PF10477.8	1	9	EIF4E-T is the transporter protein for shuttling the mRNA cap-binding protein EIF4E protein, targeting it for nuclear import. EIF4E-T contains several key binding domains including two functional leucine-rich NESs (nuclear export signals) between residues 438-447 and 613-638 in the human protein. The other two binding domains are an EIF4E-binding site, between residues 27-42 in Q9EST3, and a bipartite NLS (nuclear localisation signals) between 194-211, and these lie in family EIF4E-T_N. EIF4E is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E that is the rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation initiation [2].

It was the first mucin identified to be associated with the malignant behaviour of carcinoma cells [2]. Mouse Muc21/epiglycanin is thought to be a highly glycosylated molecule, which makes it likely that its function is dependent on its glycoforms. Cells expressing Muc21 are significantly less adherent to each other and to extracellular matrix components than control cells, and this loss of adhesion is mediated by the TR portion of Muc21 [3]. This family also now contains the repeat that was the C. elegans protein of unknown function (DUF801).

This family is part of a non-SMC subunit of condensin II which is involved in maintenance of the structural integrity of chromosomes. Condensin II is made up of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) and non-SMC subunits. The non-SMC subunits bind to the catalytic ends of the SMC subunit dimer. The condensin holocomplex is able to introduce superhelical tension into DNA in an ATP hydrolysis- dependent manner, resulting in the formation of positive supercoils in the presence of topoisomerase I and of positive knots in the presence of topoisomerase II.

Shugoshin is a crucial target of Bub1 kinase function at kinetochores, necessary for both meiotic and mitotic localisation of shugoshin to the kinetochore [1]. Human shugoshin is diffusible and mediates kinetochore-driven formation of kinetochore-microtubules during bipolar spindle assembly [2]. Further, the primary role of shugoshin is to ensure bipolar attachment of kinetochores, and its role in protecting cohesion has co-developed to facilitate this process [3].

Translation initiation in eukaryotes is mediated by the cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) present at the 5' end of all cellular mRNAs, except organellar. The cap is recognised by eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which consists of three polypeptides, including eIF4E, the cap-binding protein subunit. The interaction of the cap with eIF4E facilitates the binding of the ribosome to the mRNA. eIF4E activity is regulated in part by translational repressors, 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2 and 4E-BP3 which bind to it and prevent its assembly into eIF4F [1].	eIF_4EBP	Family	240	103.9	42	75.15	Changed	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (EIF4EBP)	2V8Y;3M94;2MX4;4UED;2V8X;3HXI;5BXV;2V8W;2JGB;4UE8;3U7X;3M93;3HXG;1EJ4;1WKW;2JGC;3AM7	0.5444447272	100	3.9	3.7536092397

Gp-FAR-1 is a member of the nematode-specific fatty-acid- and retinol-binding (FAR) family of proteins but localises to the surface of the organism, placing it in a strategic position for interaction with the host. Gp-FAR-1 functions as a broad-spectrum retinol- and fatty-acid-binding protein, and it is thought that it is involved in the evasion of primary host plant defence systems [1].

PCIF1 interacts with phosphorylated RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). The WW domain of PCIF1 can directly and preferentially bind to the phosphorylated CTD compared to the unphosphorylated CTD. PCIF1 binds to the hyperphosphorylated RNAP II (RNAP IIO) in vitro and in vivo. Double immunofluorescence labeling in HeLa cells demonstrated that PCIF1 and endogenous RNAP IIO are co-localized in the cell nucleus. Thus, PCIF1 may play a role in mRNA synthesis by modulating RNAP IIO activity.	PCIF1_WW	Family	240	172	37	25.17	Changed	Phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1 WW domain					
Vg_Tdu	PF07545.13	1	17	The mammalian TEF and the Drosophila scalloped genes belong to a conserved family of transcriptional factors that possesses a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. Transcriptional activation by these proteins likely requires interactions with specific coactivators. In Drosophila, Scalloped (Sd) interacts with Vestigial (Vg) to form a complex, which binds DNA through the Sd TEA/ATTS domain. The Sd-Vg heterodimer is a key regulator of wing development, which directly controls several target genes and is able to induce wing outgrowth when ectopically expressed. This short conserved region is needed for interaction with Sd [1].	Vg_Tdu	Family	241	30.4	73	10.97	Changed	Vestigial/Tondu family	4EAZ	0.549474312	29	1.4	4.6052631579

The domain occurs on a number of tumourigenic proteins, on some RNA-binding proteins and serine-threonine regulatory proteins [1].

Calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 are expressed in developing cardiac and skeletal muscle during embryogenesis, but calsarcin-1 is expressed specifically in adult cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, whereas calsarcin-2 is restricted to fast skeletal muscle. Calsarcins represent a novel family of sarcomeric proteins that link calcineurin with the contractile apparatus, thereby potentially coupling muscle activity to calcineurin activation [1]. Calsarcin-3, is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibres.

It would appear that FAM69 proteins are predicted to be have a protein kinase structure and function. Analysis of three-dimensional structure models and conservation of the classic catalytic motifs of protein kinases in four of human FAM69 proteins suggests they might have retained catalytic phosphotransferase activity. An EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain, inserted within the structure of the kinase domain, suggests they function as Ca2+-dependent kinases (unpublished).

CNDH2_N	PF06278.10	1	33	CNDH2_N is the N-terminal domain of the H2 subunit of the condensing II complex, found in eukaryotes but not in fungi. Eukaryotes carry at least two condensin complexes, I and II, each made up of five subunits. The functions of the two complexes are collaborative but non-overlapping. CI appears to be functional in G2 phase in the cytoplasm beginning the process of chromosomal lateral compaction while the CII is concentrated in the nucleus, possibly to counteract the activity of cohesion at this stage. In prophase, CII contributes to axial shortening of chromatids while CI continues to bring about lateral chromatid compaction, during which time the sister chromatids are joined centrally by cohesins. There appears to be just one condensin complex in fungi. CI and CII each contain SMC2 and SMC4 (structural maintenance of chromosomes) subunits, then CI has non-SMC CAP-D2 (CND1), CAP-G (CND3), and CAP-H (CND2). CII has, in addition to the two SMCs, CAP-D3, CAPG2 and CAP-H2. All four of the CAP-D and CAP-G subunits have degenerate HEAT repeats, whereas the CAP-H are kleisins or SMC-interacting proteins (ie they bind directly to the SMC subunits in the complex). The SMC molecules are each long with a small hinge-like knob at the free end of a longish strand, articulating with each other at the hinge. Each strand ends in a knob-like head that binds to one or other end of the CAP-H subunit. The HEAT-repeat containing D and G subunits bind side-by-side between the ends of the H subunit. Activity of the various parts of the complex seem to be triggered by extensive phosphorylations, eg, entry of the complex, in Sch.pombe, into the nucleus during mitosis is promoted by Cdk1 phosphorylation of SMC4/Cut3; and it has been shown that Cdk1 phosphorylates CAP-D3 at Thr1415 in He-La cells thus promoting early stage chromosomal condensation by CII.

Proteins of the BRD family contain two bromodomains that bind transcriptionally active chromatin through associations with acetylated histones H3 and H4 [1-2]. Such proteins are crucial for the regulation of cell cycle progression. On the other hand, little is known about NUT protein. NUT is known to have a Nuclear Export Sequence (NES) as well as a Nuclear Localisation Signal (NLS), both located towards the C-terminal end of the protein [1-2]. A fused NUT-GFP protein showed either cytoplasmic or nuclear localisation, suggesting that it is subject to nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. Consistent with this possibility, treatment with leptomycin B an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export resulted in re-distribution of NUT-GFP to the nucleus [3-4]. Inspection of NUT revealed a C-terminal sequence similar to known nuclear export sequences (NES) which are often regulated by phosphorylation [3-4].

All of the mammalian proteins are hypothetical and have no known function but Swiss:Q8JG54 from the chicken is annotated as being a repulsive guidance molecule (RGM). RGM is a GPI-linked axon guidance molecule of the retinotectal system. RGM is repulsive for a subset of axons, those from the temporal half of the retina. Temporal retinal axons invade the anterior optic tectum in a superficial layer, and encounter RGM expressed in a gradient with increasing concentration along the anterior-posterior axis. Temporal axons are able to receive posterior-dependent information by sensing gradients or concentrations of guidance cues. Thus, RGM is likely to provide positional information for temporal axons invading the optic tectum in the stratum opticum [1].

RIB43A was first characterised in the unicellular biflagellate, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii although highly related sequences are present in several higher eukaryotes including humans. The function of this protein is unknown although the structure of RIB43A and its association with the specialised protofilament ribbons and with basal bodies is relevant to the proposed role of ribbons in forming and stabilising doublet and triplet microtubules and in organising their three-dimensional structure. Human RIB43A homologues could represent a structural requirement in centriole replication in dividing cells [1].	RIB43A	Family	262	310.7	28	87.91	Changed	RIB43A		0.6579920549	369	-58.3	-18.7640811072

SATBs assemble into a tetramer via the ULD domain, and the tetramerisation of SATBs are essential for recognising specific DNA sequences (such as multiple AT-rich DNA fragments). Thus, SATBs may regulate gene expression directly by binding to various promoters and upstream regions and thereby influencing promoter activity [1].

They contain a Vinculin binding site (VBS) composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix four. Activation of the VBS causes subsequent recruitment of Vinculin, which enables maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions. Formation of the complex between VBS and Vinculin requires prior unfolding of this middle domain: once released from the talin hydrophobic core, the VBS helix is then available to induce the 'bundle conversion' conformational change within the vinculin head domain thereby displacing the intramolecular interaction with the vinculin tail, allowing vinculin to bind actin [1].

CENP-L	PF13092.5	1	80	CENP-L is one of the components that assembles onto the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere. The centromere, which is the basic element of chromosome inheritance, is epigenetically determined in mammals. CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, assembles an array of nucleosomes and it is this that seems to be the prime candidate for specifying centromere identity. CENP-A nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T, CENP-U(50), CENP-C and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Additionally, there are seven other subunits which make up the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere, CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S, also assembling on the CENP-A NAC [2].

Eukaryotic cilia and flagella present in diverse types of cells perform motile, sensory, and developmental functions in organisms from protists to humans. They are centred by precisely organised, microtubule-based structures, the axonemes. The axoneme consists of two central singlet microtubules, called the central pair, and nine outer doublet microtubules. These structures are well-conserved during evolution. The outer doublet microtubules, each composed of A and B sub-fibres, are connected to each other by nexin links, while the central pair is held at the centre of the axoneme by radial spokes. The radial spokes are T-shaped structures extending from the A-tubule of each outer doublet microtubule to the centre of the axoneme. Radial spoke protein 3 (RSP3), is present at the proximal end of the spoke stalk and helps in anchoring the radial spoke to the outer doublet. It is thought that radial spokes regulate the activity of inner arm dynein through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [1].

The viral protein interacts stably with non structural (NS) protein NS2, causing a conformational change in NS2-NS3 and stimulates NS2-NS3 cleavage in trans. Cleavage of NS2-NS3 increases cytopathogenicity and consequently aids viral replication. Jiv therefore acts as a regulating cofactor for NS2 auto-protease. The efficient release of NS3 from the viral polypeptide by Jiv is considered crucial to the pestivirus cytopathogenicity [1]. In eukaryotes, it usually lies 40 residues downstream of DnaJ family Pfam:PF00226. However, the function in eukaryotes is still unknown.

The N-terminal regions of these sequences are less conserved than the C-terminal regions, and are highly acidic [1]. The C. elegans homolog, UNC-76 (Swiss:Q7JNU9), may play structural and signalling roles in the control of axonal extension and adhesion (particularly in the presence of adjacent neuronal cells [2]) and these roles have also been postulated for other FEZ family proteins [1]. Certain homologs have been definitively found to interact with the N-terminal variable region (V1) of PKC-zeta, and this interaction causes cytoplasmic translocation of the FEZ family protein in mammalian neuronal cells [2]. The C-terminal region probably participates in the association with the regulatory domain of PKC-zeta [2]. The members of this family are predicted to form coiled-coil structures [2,3], which may interact with members of the RhoA family of signalling proteins [2], but are not thought to contain other characteristic protein motifs [3]. Certain members of this family are expressed almost exclusively in the brain, whereas others (such as FEZ2, Swiss:Q76LN0) are expressed in other tissues, and are thought to perform similar but unknown functions in these tissues [3].

It is a ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) that is synthesised in a precursor form of 85 amino-acid residues. In humans the enzyme for Ufm1 is Uba5 and the conjugating enzyme is Ufc1. Prior to activation by Uba5 the extra two amino acids at the C-terminal region of the human pro-Ufm1 protein are removed to expose Gly whose residue is necessary for conjugation to target molecule(s). The mature Ufm1 is conjugated to yet unidentified endogenous proteins,[1]. While Ubiquitin and many Ubls possess the conserved C-terminal di-glycine that is adenylated by each specific E1 or E1-like enzyme, respectively, in an ATP-dependent manner, Ufm1(1-83) possesses a single glycine at its C-terminus, which is followed by a Ser-Cys dipeptide in the precursor form of Ufm1.

DMAP1	PF05499.11	1	26	DNA methylation can contribute to transcriptional silencing through several transcriptionally repressive complexes, which include methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The chief enzyme that maintains mammalian DNA methylation, DNMT1, can also establish a repressive transcription complex. The non-catalytic amino terminus of DNMT1 binds to HDAC2 and DMAP1 (for DNMT1 associated protein), and can mediate transcriptional repression. DMAP1 has intrinsic transcription repressive activity, and binds to the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101. DMAP1 is targeted to replication foci through interaction with the far N terminus of DNMT1 throughout S phase, whereas HDAC2 joins DNMT1 and DMAP1 only during late S phase, providing a platform for how histones may become deacetylated in heterochromatin following replication [1].

RGM is a GPI-linked axon guidance molecule of the retinotectal system. RGM is repulsive for a subset of axons, those from the temporal half of the retina. Temporal retinal axons invade the anterior optic tectum in a superficial layer, and encounter RGM expressed in a gradient with increasing concentration along the anterior-posterior axis. Temporal axons are able to receive posterior-dependent information by sensing gradients or concentrations of guidance cues. Thus, RGM is likely to provide positional information for temporal axons invading the optic tectum in the stratum opticum [1].

CNDH2_C	PF16858.4	1	26	CNDH2_C is the C-terminal domain of the H2 subunit of the condensin II complex, found in eukaryotes but not fungi. Eukaryotes carry at least two condensin complexes, I and II, each made up of five subunits. The functions of the two complexes are collaborative but non-overlapping. CI appears to be functional in G2 phase in the cytoplasm beginning the process of chromosomal lateral compaction while the CII are concentrated in the nucleus, possibly to counteract the activity of cohesion at this stage. In prophase, CII contributes to axial shortening of chromatids while CI continues to bring about lateral chromatid compaction, during which time the sister chromatids are joined centrally by cohesins. There appears to be just one condensin complex in fungi. CI and CII each contain SMC2 and SMC4 (structural maintenance of chromosomes) subunits, then CI has non-SMC CAP-D2 (CND1), CAP-G (CND3), and CAP-H (CND2). CII has, in addition to the two SMCs, CAP-D3, CAPG2 and CAP-H2. All four of the CAP-D and CAP-G subunits have degenerate HEAT repeats, whereas the CAP-H are kleisins or SMC-interacting proteins (ie they bind directly to the SMC subunits in the complex). The SMC molecules are each long with a small hinge-like knob at the free end of a longish strand, articulating with each other at the hinge. Each strand ends in a knob-like head that binds to one or other end of the CAP-H subunit. The HEAT-repeat containing D and G subunits bind side-by-side between the ends of the H subunit. Activity of the various parts of the complex seem to be triggered by extensive phosphorylations, eg, entry of the complex, in Sch.pombe, into the nucleus during mitosis is promoted by Cdk1 phosphorylation of SMC4/Cut3; and it has been shown that Cdk1 phosphorylates CAP-D3 at Thr1415 in He-La cells thus promoting early stage chromosomal condensation by CII.

WIF	PF02019.17	1	37	The WIF domain is found in the RYK tyrosine kinase receptors Swiss:P34925 and WIF the Wnt-inhibitory- factor. The domain is extracellular and contains two conserved cysteines that may form a disulphide bridge. This domain is Wnt binding in WIF, and it has been suggested that RYK may also bind to Wnt [1]. The WIF domain is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and it comprises nine beta-strands and two alpha-helices, with two of the beta-strands (6 and 9) interrupted by four and six residues of irregular secondary structure, respectively. Considering that the activity of Wnts depends on the presence of a palmitoylated cysteine residue in their amino-terminal polypeptide segment, Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth factors, it is likely that the WIF domain recognises and binds to Wnts that have been activated by palmitoylation and that the recognition of palmitoylated Wnts by WIF-1 is effected by its WIF domain rather than by its EGF domains. A strong binding affinity for palmitoylated cysteine residues would further explain the remarkably high affinity of human WIF-1 not only for mammalian Wnts, but also for Wnts from Xenopus and Drosophila [2].

CENP-N	PF05238.12	1	28	CHL4 is a protein involved in chromosome segregation [1]. It is a component of the central kinetochore which mediates the attachment of the centromere to the mitotic spindle [2]. CENP-N is one of the components that assembles onto the CENP-A-nucleosome-associated (NAC) centromere. The centromere, which is the basic element of chromosome inheritance, is epigenetically determined in mammals. CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, assembles an array of nucleosomes and it is this that seems to be the prime candidate for specifying centromere identity. CENP-A nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T, CENP-U(50), CENP-C and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Additionally, there are seven other subunits which make up the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere, CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S, also assembling on the CENP-A NAC [4].

Atrophin-1	PF03154.14	1	6	Atrophin-1 is the protein product of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene. DRPLA OMIM:125370 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene on chromosome 12p. This results in an extended polyglutamine region in atrophin-1, that is thought to confer toxicity to the protein, possibly through altering its interactions with other proteins [1,2]. The expansion of a CAG repeat is also the underlying defect in six other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. One interaction of expanded polyglutamine repeats that is thought to be pathogenic is that with the short glutamine repeat in the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. This interaction draws CBP away from its usual nuclear location to the expanded polyglutamine repeat protein aggregates that are characteristic of the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. This interferes with CBP-mediated transcription and causes cytotoxicity [2].	Atrophin-1	Family	311	493.9	31	52.7	Changed	Atrophin-1 family		0.4714502002	912	-418.1	-84.6527637174

In Drosophila melanogaster, Nanos functions as a localised determinant of posterior pattern. Nanos RNA is localised to the posterior pole of the maturing egg cell and encodes a protein that emanates from this localised source. Nanos acts as a translational repressor and thereby establishes a gradient of the morphogen Hunchback [1]. Xcat-2 is found in the vegetal cortical region and is inherited by the vegetal blasomeres during development, and is degraded very early in development. The localised and maternally restricted expression of Xcat-2 RNA suggests a role for its protein in setting up regional differences in gene expression that occur early in development [2].	zf-nanos	Family	316	55.3	53	24.22	Changed	Nanos RNA binding domain	3ALR	0.5278889695	53	2.3	4.1591320072

The N-terminus makes contacts with the minor groove. There is a base specific recognition between Tc3 and the transposon DNA. The DNA binding domain forms a dimer in which each monomer binds a separate transposon end. This implicates that the dimer has a role in synapsis and is necessary for the simultaneous cleavage of both transposon termini [1].

Cut8	PF08559.9	1	88	In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cut8 is a nuclear envelope protein that physically interacts with and tethers 26S proteasome in the nucleus resulting in the nuclear accumulation of proteasome [1]. Cut8 comprises three functional domains. An N-terminal lysine-rich segment which binds to the proteasome when ubiquitinated, a central dimerisation domain and a C-terminal nine-helix, pdb:3q5w, bundle which shows structural similarity to 14-3-3 phosphoprotein-binding domains. The helical bundle is necessary for liposome and cholesterol binding [2]. Cut8 is a proteasome substrate and the N-terminal segment is polyubiquitinated and functions as a degron tag. Ubiquitination of the amino N-terminal segment is essential for the function of Cut8 [1]. Lysine residues in the N-terminal segment of Cut8 are required for physical interaction with proteasome [1]. In fission yeast the function of Cut8 has been demonstrated to be regulated by ubiquitin-conjugating Rhp6/Ubc2/Rad6 and ligating enzymes Ubr1 [1]. Cut8 homologues have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Dictyostelium discoideum [1].

TNRC6 are trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6 proteins required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing that are localised to the P bodies (processing bodies). P bodies are cytoplasmic mRNP aggregates that are involved in general mRNA translation repression and decay, including nonsense-mediated decay. Thus GW182 proteins are essential for microRNA-mediated translational repression and deadenylation in animal cells being a major component of miRISCs. The interaction motif that binds to PABC is ShNWPPEFHPGVPWKGLQ [1]. This region lies between a Q-rich region and the RRM, or RNA-recognition motif, Pfam:PF13893.

Med27	PF11571.7	1	50	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species {1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function [3]. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. The ubiquitous expression of Med27 mRNA suggests a universal requirement for Med27 in transcriptional initiation. Loss of Crsp34/Med27 decreases amacrine cell number, but increases the number of rod photoreceptor cells [4].

TAN	PF11640.7	1	106	ATM is a large protein kinase, in humans, critical for responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Tel1, the orthologue from budding yeast, also regulates responses to DSBs. Tel1 is important for maintaining viability and for phosphorylation of the DNA damage signal transducer kinase Rad53 (an orthologue of mammalian CHK2). In addition to functioning in the response to DSBs, numerous findings indicate that Tel1/ATM regulates telomeres. The overall domain structure of Tel1/ATM is shared by proteins of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, but this family carries a unique and functionally important TAN sequence motif, near its N-terminal, LxxxKxxE/DRxxxL. which is conserved specifically in the Tel1/ATM subclass of the PIKKs.

Members of this family catalyze nucleic acid modifications, such as thymidine hydroxylation during base J synthesis in kinetoplastids [2], and the conversion of 5 methyl-cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (hmC) [3], or further oxidation to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) [4]. Metazoan TET proteins contain a cysteine-rich region inserted into the core of the DSBH fold. Vertebrate TET proteins are oncogenes that are mutated in various myeloid cancers [5].

DUF3534	PF12053.7	1	14	This presumed domain is functionally uncharacterised. This domain is found in eukaryotes. This domain is about 150 amino acids in length. This eukaryotic domain is found associated with Pfam:PF00595. It has a conserved GILD sequence motif. Family members have been found to be essential for cell polarity establishment and maintenance such as Par3 (partitioning defective) Swiss:Q8TEW0 and involved in conversion of histidine into ammonia (a crucial step for forming histamine in humans) such as Histidine ammonia lyase (HAL) Swiss:P42357. This N-terminal domain is found to mediate oligomerization critical for the membrane localization of Par-3. It is also found to possess a self-association capacity via a “front-to-back” mode in Par-3 and HAL proteins. However, unlike the Par-3 N-terminal domain which self-assembles into a left-handed helical filament, the HAL N-terminal domain does not tend to form a helical filament but rather self-assembles into circular oligomeric particles. This has been suggested to be likely due to the absence of equivalent charged residues that are essential for the longitudinal packing of the Par-3 N-terminal domain filament [1].

Possibly, the C-terminus extends by 30 amino acids and forms a separate domain. DPF2 interacts with estrogen related receptor alpha (Err-alpha), an orphan receptor which acts as a regulator in energy metabolism [1]. It was also identified as an adaptor molecule that links nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa-B) dimer RelB/p52 and switch/sucrose-nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling factor [2].

NKAINs have highly conserved trans-membrane domains but otherwise no other characterised domains. NKAINs may function as subunits of pore or channel structures in neurons or they may affect the function of other membrane proteins. They are likely to function within the membrane bilayer [1].

RGS-like	PF09128.10	1	7	Members of this family adopt a structure consisting of twelve helices that fold into a compact domain that contains the overall structural scaffold observed in other RGS proteins and three additional helical elements that pack closely to it. Helices 1-9 comprise the RGS (Pfam:PF00615) fold, in which helices 4-7 form a classic antiparallel bundle adjacent to the other helices. Like other RGS structures, helices 7 and 8 span the length of the folded domain and form essentially one continuous helix with a kink in the middle. Helices 10-12 form an apparently stable C-terminal extension of the structural domain, and although other RGS proteins lack this structure, these elements are intimately associated with the rest of the structural framework by hydrophobic interactions. Members of the family bind to active G-alpha proteins, promoting GTP hydrolysis by the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, thereby inactivating the G protein and rapidly switching off G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathways [1].

In the budding-yeast, Mif2, the yeast homologue, binds in the CDEIII region of the centromere, and has been shown to recruit a substantial subset of all inner and outer kinetochore proteins [1]. Mif2 adopts a cupin fold and is extremely similar both in polypeptide chain conformation and in dimer geometry to the dimerisation domain of a bacterial transcription factor [1]. The Mif2 dimer appears to be part of an enhanceosome-like structure that nucleates kinetochore assembly in budding yeast [1].

SepSecS	PF05889.12	1	5	Early annotation suggested this family, SepSecS, of several eukaryotic and archaeal proteins, was involved in antigen-antibodies responses in the liver and pancreas [1,2]. Structural studies show that the family is O-phosphoseryl-tRNA(Sec) selenium transferase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is the only amino acid whose biosynthesis occurs on its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). SepSecS catalyses the final step in the formation of the amino acid [3,4,5,6]. The early observation that autoantibodies isolated from patients with type I autoimmune hepatitis targeted a ribonucleoprotein complex containing tRNASec led to the identification and characterisation of the archaeal and the human SepSecS [2]. SepSecS forms its own branch in the family of fold-type I pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzymes that goes back to the last universal common ancestor which explains why the archaeal sequences Swiss:Q8TXK0 and Swiss:Q8TYR3 are annotated as being pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.

The two related human TRF proteins hTRF1 and hTRF2 form homodimers and bind directly to telomeric TTAGGG repeats via the myb DNA binding domain Pfam:PF00249 at the carboxy terminus [1]. TRF1 is implicated in telomere length regulation and TRF2 in telomere protection [1]. Other telomere complex associated proteins are recruited through their interaction with either TRF1 or TRF2. The fission yeast protein Taz1p (telomere-associated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) has similarity to both hTRF1 and hTRF2 and may perform the dual functions of TRF1 and TRF2 at fission yeast telomeres [2]. This domain is composed of multiple alpha helices [3] arranged in a solenoid conformation similar to TPR repeats.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder and is characterised by the presence of hamartomas in many organs, such as brain, skin, heart, lung, and kidney. It is caused by mutation either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene. TSC1 encodes a protein, hamartin, containing two coiled-coil regions, which have been shown to mediate binding to tuberin. The TSC2 gene codes for tuberin Pfam:PF03542. These two proteins function within the same pathway(s) regulating cell cycle, cell growth, adhesion, and vesicular trafficking [1].

It carries the region of enzymic activity between 320 and 344 at the extreme C-terminal end [1]. Oligoadenylate synthetases are antiviral enzymes that counteract vial attack by degrading viral RNA. The enzyme uses ATP in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesise 2'.5'-oligoadenylates, which activate latent ribonuclease, resulting in degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of virus replication [2].

Med13_N	PF11597.7	1	15	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants through fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species [1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Med13 is part of the ancillary kinase module, together with Med12, CDK8 and CycC, which in yeast is implicated in transcriptional repression, though most of this activity is likely attributable to the CDK8 kinase. The large Med12 and Med13 proteins are required for specific developmental processes in Drosophila, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans but their biochemical functions are not understood [4].

It forms an antiparallel beta-hairpin that binds perpendicular to the strands of the beta-sandwich of ASF1a N-terminal core domain, via beta-sheet, salt bridge and van der Waals interactions [1]. The two histone chaperone proteins, HIRA and ASF1a, form a heterodimer with histones H3 and H4. HIRA is the human orthologue of Hir proteins known to silence histone gene expression and create transcriptionally silent heterochromatin in yeast, flies, plants and humans.

More specifically, it is termed the homeo-domain homologous region (HHR), as it is similar to the DNA-binding region of homeo-domain proteins [2]. Other homeo-domain proteins have been implicated in specifying positional information during embryonic development, and in the regulation of the expression of cell-type specific genes [2]. The Abl-interactor proteins are thought to coordinate the cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of the Abl-family kinases, and seem to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganisation, but their precise role remains unclear [1].

APP_E2	PF12925.6	1	20	The E2 domain is the largest of the conserved domains of the amyloid precursor protein. The structure of E2 consists of two coiled-coil sub-structures connected through a continuous helix, and bears an unexpected resemblance to the spectrin family of protein structures.E 2 can reversibly dimerise in solution, and the dimerisation occurs along the longest dimension of the molecule in an antiparallel orientation, which enables the N-terminal substructure of one monomer to pack against the C-terminal substructure of a second monomer. The high degree of conservation of residues at the putative dimer interface suggests that the E2 dimer observed in the crystal could be physiologically relevant. Heparin sulfate proteoglycans, the putative ligands for the precursor present in extracellular matrix, bind to E2 at a conserved and positively charged site near the dimer interface [1].

During meiotic prophase, telomeres cluster to form a bouquet arrangement of chromosomes. SUN and KASH domain proteins form complexes that span both membranes of the nuclear envelope. The KASH domain links the dynein motor complex of the microtubules, through the outer nuclear membrane to the Sad1 domain in the inner nuclear membrane which then interacts with the bouquet proteins Bqt1 and Bqt2 that are complexed with Bqt4, Rap1 and Taz1 and attached to the telomere [2]. SUN domain-containing proteins are essential for recruiting KASH domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane, and KASH domains provide a generic NE tethering device for functionally distinct proteins whose cytoplasmic domains mediate nuclear positioning, maintain physical connections with other cellular organelles, and possibly even influence chromosome dynamics [3].

Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Med16 is one of the subunits of the Tail portion of the Mediator complex and is required for lipopolysaccharide gene-expression [4]. Several members including the human protein, Swiss:Q9Y2X0, have one or more WD40 domains on them, Pfam:PF00400.

TUG has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL1) which in similar proteins appears to participate in protein-protein interactions [1].

BEX	PF04538.11	1	70	This is a family of transcription elongation factors which includes those referred to as Bex proteins as well as those named TCEAL7. Bex1 was shown to be a novel link between neurotrophin signalling, the cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation, suggesting it might function by coordinating internal cellular states with the ability of cells to respond to external signals [2]. TCEAL7 has been shown negatively to regulate the NF-kappaB pathway, hence being important in ovarian cancer as it one of the genes frequently downregulated in this cancer. A closely related protein, TFIIS/TCEA, found in Pfam:PF07500 is involved in transcription elongation and transcript fidelity. TFIIS/TCEA promotes 3' endoribonuclease activity of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and allows pol II to bypass transcript pause or 'arrest' during elongation process. It is thus possible that BEX is also acting in this way [2].	BEX	Family	396	126.9	28	82.29	Changed	Brain expressed X-linked like family		0.5016778051	91	35.9	28.2899921198

This domain is also present at the C-terminus of coiled-coil proteins from Drosophila and S. pombe, and that from the Drosophila protein is sufficient for targeting to the centrosome in mammalian cells. The function of these proteins is unknown but they seem good candidates for having a centrosomal or spindle pole body location.

Studies in S. pombe show that the proteins carrying this motif are mRNA decapping proteins.In addition, this motif is found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae two intrinsically disordered decapping enhancers Edc1 and Edc2, which show limited sequence conservation with human PNRC2. This motif in the N-terminal domain serves two purposes: it enhances the activity of the catalytic domain by recognizing part of the mRNA cap structure (i.e. activation motif) , and secondly, it directly interacts with the decapping activator Dcp1. Mutation in the (YAG) sequence led to los of activity of activate the decapping complex.

Telomerase_RBD	PF12009.7	1	136	Telomeres in most organisms are comprised of tandem simple sequence repeats [1]. The total length of telomeric repeat sequence at each chromosome end is determined in a balance of sequence loss and sequence addition [1]. One major influence on telomere length is the enzyme telomerase [1]. It is a reverse transcriptase that adds these simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme [1]. The RNA binding domain of telomerase - TRBD - is made up of twelve alpha helices and two short beta sheets [2]. How telomerase and associated regulatory factors physically interact and function with each other to maintain appropriate telomere length is poorly understood. It is known however that TRBD is involved in formation of the holoenzyme (which performs the telomere extension) in addition to recognition and binding of RNA [2].

Peptidase_M60	PF13402.5	1	29	This family of peptidases contains a zinc metallopeptidase motif (HEXXHX(8,28)E) and possesses mucinase activity [1]. It includes the viral enhancins as well as enhancin-like peptidases from bacterial species. Enhancins are a class of metalloproteases found in some baculoviruses that enhance viral infection by degrading the peritrophic membrane (PM) of the insect midgut [1,2]. Bacterial enhancins are found to be cytotoxic when compared to viral enhancin, however, suggesting that the bacterial enhancins do not enhance infection in the same way as viral enhancin. Bacterial enhancins may have evolved a distinct biochemical function [2]. These bacterial domains are peptidases targetting host glycoproteins and thus probably play an important role in successful colonisation of both vertebrate mucosal surfaces and the invertebrate digestive tract by both mutualistic and pathogenic microbes [3]. This family has been augmented by a merge with the sequences in the Enhancin Pfam family.

Spherulin4	PF12138.7	0	95	This protein is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Proteins in this family are typically between 250 and 398 amino acids in length. There is a conserved NPG sequence motif and there are two completely conserved G residues that may be functionally important. Starvation will often induce spherulation - the production of spores - and this process may involve DNA-methylation. Changes in the methylation of spherulin4 are associated with the formation of spherules, but these changes are probably transient. Methylation of the gene accompanies its transcriptional activation, and spherulin4 mRNA is only detectable in late spherulating cultures and mature spherules. It is a spherulation-specific protein.

Within the yeast Tpm1 and Tpm2, biochemical and sequence analyses indicate that Tpm2p spans four actin monomers along a filament, whereas Tpm1p spans five. Despite its shorter length, Tpm2p can compete with Tpm1p for binding to F-actin. Over-expression of Tpm2p in vivo alters the axial budding of haploids to a bipolar pattern, and this can be partially suppressed by co-over-expression of Tpm1p. This suggests distinct functions for the two tropomyosins, and indicates that the ratio between them is important for correct morphogenesis [1]. The family also contains higher eukaryote Tpm3 members.	Tropomyosin_1	Family	454	118.9	37	67.79	Changed	Tropomyosin like	3U59;3U1A;1IC2;3U1C	0.681971507	143	-24.1	-20.2691337258

These proteins share a number of features; for example, they all have coiled-coil regions and all three are associated with nuclear pores [1,2,3]. TPR is thought to be a component of nuclear pore complex- attached intra-nuclear filaments [1], and is implicated in nuclear protein import [2]. Moreover, its N-terminal region is involved in the activation of oncogenic kinases, possibly by mediating the dimerisation of kinase domains or by targeting these kinases to the nuclear pore complex [2]. MLP1 and MLP2 are involved in the process of telomere length regulation, where they are thought to interact with proteins such as Tel1p and modulate their activity [4].

The domain is conserved from yeasts to humans. Yeast Sre1 is the orthologue of mammalian sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), and it responds to changes in oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis as an indirect measure of oxygen availability. However, unlike the prolyl 4-hydroxylases that regulate mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor, Ofd1 uses multiple domains to regulate Sre1N degradation by oxygen; the Ofd1 N-terminal dioxygenase domain is required for oxygen sensing and this Ofd1 C-terminal domain accelerates Sre1N degradation in yeasts [1].

Ax_dynein_light	PF10211.8	1	90	Axonemal dynein light chain proteins play a dynamic role in flagellar and cilia motility. Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are complex organelles consisting of a core structure, the axoneme, which is composed of nine microtubule doublets forming a cylinder that surrounds a pair of central singlet microtubules. This ultra-structural arrangement seems to be one of the most stable micro-tubular assemblies known and is responsible for the flagellar and ciliary movement of a large number of organisms ranging from protozoan to mammals. This light chain interacts directly with the N-terminal half of the heavy chains [2].

Arabidopsis thaliana contains PRORP enzymes (PRORP1, PRORP2 and PRORP3) where PRORP1 localizes to mitochondria as well as chloroplasts, while PRORP2 and PRORP3 are found in the nucleus. In humans and most other metazoans, mt-RNase P is composed of three protein subunits (mitochondrial RNase P proteins 1–3; MRPP1-3), homologs to the Arabidopsis thaliana PRORP1-3. This domain corresponds to the metallonuclease domain of PRORPs. PRORP1 has 22% sequence identity to the human homologue MRPP3. PRORP1 crystal structure shows a V-shaped tripartite structure with a C-terminal metallonuclease domain of the NYN (N4BL1, YacP-like nuclease) family, with a typical and functional two-metal-ion catalytic site that has conserved aspartate residues [2].

C-8 sterol isomerase (delta-8--delta-7 sterol isomerase), catalyses a reaction in ergosterol biosynthesis, which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols [1]. Sigma 1 receptor is a low molecular mass mammalian protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum [2], which interacts with endogenous steroid hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone [3]. It also binds the sigma ligands, which are are a set of chemically unrelated drugs including haloperidol, pentazocine, and ditolylguanidine [2]. Sigma1 effectors are not well understood, but sigma1 agonists have been observed to affect NMDA receptor function, the alpha-adrenergic system and opioid analgesia.

Folliculin	PF11704.7	1	98	In yeast cells this family functions in the regulated delivery of Gap1p (a general amino acid permease) to the cell surface, perhaps as a component of a post-Golgi secretory-vesicle coat complex [1]. Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD)4 syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by hamartomas of skin follicles, lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cell carcinoma. Folliculin is the protein from the BHD4 gene and is found to have no significant homology to any other human proteins. It is expressed in most tissues. These same symptoms also occur in TSC or tuberous sclerosis complex, suggesting that the same pathway is involved, and it is likely that the target is the down-stream Tor2 - an essential gene. Folliculin appears to bind Tor2, and down-regulation of Tor2 activity leads to up-regulation of nitrogen responsive genes including membrane transporters and amino acid permeases [2].

UNC45-central	PF11701.7	1	107	The UNC-45 or small muscle protein 1 of C.elegans is expressed in two forms from different genomic positions in mammals, as a general tissue protein UNC-45a and a specific form Unc-45b expressed only in striated and skeletal muscle. All members carry up to three amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains towards their N-terminal, a UCS domain at the C-terminal that contains a number of Arm repeats Pfam:PF00514 and this central region of approximately 400 residues. Both the general form and the muscle form of UNC-45 function in myotube formation through cell fusion. Myofibril formation requires both GC and SM UNC-45, consistent with the fact that the cytoskeleton is necessary for the development and maintenance of organised myofibrils [1]. The S. pombe Rng3p, is crucial for cell shape, normal actin cytoskeleton, and contractile ring assembly, and is essential for assembly of the myosin II-containing progenitors of the contractile ring. Widespread defects in the cytoskeleton are found in null mutants of all three fungal proteins [2]. Mammalian Unc45 is found to act as a specific chaperone during the folding of myosin and the assembly of striated muscle by forming a stable complex with the general chaperone Hsp90. The exact function of this central region is not known [3].

These membrane channels are heteromeric complexes that comprise pore-forming alpha-subunits and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) [1]. CaM binds to the SK channel through this the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), which is located in an intracellular region of the alpha-subunit immediately carboxy-terminal to the pore. Channel opening is triggered when Ca2+ binds the EF hands in the N-lobe of CaM. The structure of this domain complexed with CaM is known [1].

Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei, and in plants and fungi small interfering (si)RNAs associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications. This family protein, NRDE-2, is required for small interfering (si)RNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNA interference, RNAi, the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA [1].

Segment II of misato is a major contributor to its greater length compared with the various tubulins. The most significant sequence similarities to this 54-amino acid region are from a motif found in the heavy chains of myosins from different organisms. A comparison of segment II with the vertebrate myosin heavy chains reveals that it is homologous to a myosin peptide in the hinge region linking the S2 and LMM domains. Segment II also contains heptad repeats which are characteristic of the myosin tail alpha-helical coiled-coils [1]. This myosin-like homology may be due only to the fact that both myosin and Misato carry coiled-coils, which appear similar but are not necessarily homologous (Wood V, personal communication).

HEAT_PBS	PF03130.15	1	221	This family contains a short bi-helical repeat that is related to Pfam:PF02985. Cyanobacteria and red algae harvest light energy using macromolecular complexes known as phycobilisomes (PBS), peripherally attached to the photosynthetic membrane. The major components of PBS are the phycobiliproteins. These heterodimeric proteins are covalently attached to phycobilins: open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, which function as the photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. Phycobiliproteins differ in sequence and in the nature and number of attached phycobilins to each of their subunits. This family includes the lyase enzymes that specifically attach particular phycobilins to apophycobiliprotein subunits. The most comprehensively studied of these is the CpcE/F lyase Swiss:P31967 Swiss:P31968, which attaches phycocyanobilin (PCB) to the alpha subunit of apophycocyanin [1]. Similarly, MpeU/V attaches phycoerythrobilin to phycoerythrin II, while CpeY/Z is thought to be involved in phycoerythrobilin (PEB) attachment to phycoerythrin (PE) I (PEs I and II differ in sequence and in the number of attached molecules of PEB: PE I has five, PE II has six) [2]. All the reactions of the above lyases involve an apoprotein cysteine SH addition to a terminal delta 3,3'-double bond. Such a reaction is not possible in the case of phycoviolobilin (PVB), the phycobilin of alpha-phycoerythrocyanin (alpha-PEC). It is thought that in this case, PCB, not PVB, is first added to apo-alpha-PEC, and is then isomerised to PVB. The addition reaction has been shown to occur in the presence of either of the components of alpha-PEC-PVB lyase PecE or PecF (or both). The isomerisation reaction occurs only when both PecE and PecF components are present, i.e. the PecE/F phycobiliprotein lyase is also a phycobilin isomerase [3]. Another member of this family is the NblB protein Swiss:Q9Z3G5, whose similarity to the phycobiliprotein lyases was previously noted [4]. This constitutively expressed protein is not known to have any lyase activity. It is thought to be involved in the coordination of PBS degradation with environmental nutrient limitation. It has been suggested that the similarity of NblB to the phycobiliprotein lyases is due to the ability to bind tetrapyrrole phycobilins via the common repeated motif [4].

COX17	PF05051.12	1	103	Cox17 is essential for the assembly of functional cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and for delivery of copper ions to the mitochondrion for insertion into the enzyme in yeast [1]. The structure of Cox17 [2] shows the protein to have an unstructured N-terminal region followed by two helices and several unstructured C-terminal residues. The Cu(I) binding site has been modelled as two-coordinate with ligation by conserved residues Cys23 and Cys26.

Coa1	PF08695.9	1	38	Coa1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that associates with Shy1 and is required for cytochrome oxidase complex IV assembly. It contains a conserved hydrophobic segment (amino acids 74-92) with the potential to form a membrane-spanning helix. The N-terminus of Coa1 is rich in positively charged amino acids and could form an amphipathic alpha helix, characteristic of a mitochondrial presequence. A cleavage site for the mitochondrial processing peptidase is predicted adjacent to the presequence. Upon in vitro import into mitochondria, Coa1 is processed to a mature form, indicating that it possesses a cleavable presequence [1]. The eukaryotic cytochrome oxidase complex consists of 12-13 subunits, with three mitochondrial encoded subunits, Cox1-Cox3, forming the core enzyme. Translation of the Cox1 transcript requires the two promoters, Pet309 and Mss51, and the latter has an additional role in translational elongation. Coa1 is necessary for linking the activity of Mss51 to Cox1 insertion into the assembly complex [2].

Using a diverse set of substrates and direct ubiquitination assays, analysis revealed that HRD4/NPL4 is required for a poorly characterised step in ER-associated degradation after ubiquitination of target proteins but before their recognition by the 26S proteasome [1]. This region of the protein contains possibly two zinc binding motifs (Bateman A pers. obs.). Npl4p physically associates with Cdc48p via Ufd1p to form a Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex. The Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex functions in the recognition of several polyubiquitin-tagged proteins and facilitates their presentation to the 26S proteasome for processive degradation or even more specific processing.	zf-NPL4	Family	513	134.6	48	22.6	Changed	NPL4 family, putative zinc binding region		0.3465040291	138	-3.4	-2.5260029718

The assembly and function of the mitotic spindle requires the activity of a number of microtubule-binding proteins. Katanin, a heterodimeric microtubule-severing ATPase, is found localized at mitotic spindle poles.

The N-terminal subdomain is made up of a six-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains [1].

The domain is a catalytic domain responsible for the glucanotransferase function. It belongs to the alpha-amylase clan and is predicted to have a structure of a 8-stranded alpha/beta barrel (TIM barrel) where strands are interrupted by long loops and additional mini-domains. In most other amylases, the catalytic domain is followed by a beta- barrel substrate binding domain, but presence of such a domain cannot be verified in the human (and other eukaryotic) GDE enzymes.	hDGE_amylase	Domain	559	369.3	37	28.45	Changed	Glycogen debranching enzyme, glucanotransferase domain		0.5246181916	394	-24.7	-6.6883292716

Apc11 acts as an E3 enzyme and is responsible for recruiting E2s to the APC and for mediating the subsequent transfer of ubiquitin to APC substrates in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this RING-H2 finger protein defines the minimal ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, and the integrity of the RING-H2 finger is essential for budding yeast cell viability [3].	zf-ANAPC11	Family	561	79	45	49.76	Changed	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 11 RING-H2 finger	4UI9;2MT5;4R2Y	0.747043021	84	-5	-6.3291139241

Vps8	PF12816.6	1	161	Vps8 is one of the Golgi complex components necessary for vacuolar sorting [1]. Eukaryotic cells contain a highly dynamic endo-membrane system, in which individual organelles keep their identity despite continuous vesicle generation and fusion. Vesicles that bud from a donor membrane are targeted and delivered to each individual organelle, where they release their cargo after fusion with the acceptor membrane. Vps8 is the core component of the endosomal tethering complex CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering). Vps8 co-operates with Vps21-GTP to mediate endosomal clustering in a reaction that is dependent on Vps3. Vps8 is the only CORVET subunit that is enriched on late endosomes, suggesting that it is a marker for the maturation of late endosomes. Late endosomes form intralumenal vesicles, and the resulting multivesicular bodies fuse with the vacuole to release their cargoes [2].

In pepsinogen A, the first 11 residues of the mature pepsin sequence are displaced by residues of the propeptide. The propeptide contains two helices that block the active site cleft, in particular the conserved Asp11 residue, in pepsin, hydrogen bonds to a conserved Arg residues in the propeptide. This hydrogen bond stabilises the propeptide conformation and is probably responsible for triggering the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin under acidic conditions [1,2].

SPC12	PF06645.12	1	145	This family consists of several microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit proteins. Translocation of polypeptide chains across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is triggered by signal sequences. Subsequently, signal recognition particle interacts with its membrane receptor and the ribosome-bound nascent chain is targeted to the ER where it is transferred into a protein-conducting channel. At some point, a second signal sequence recognition event takes place in the membrane and translocation of the nascent chain through the membrane occurs. The signal sequence of most secretory and membrane proteins is cleaved off at this stage. Cleavage occurs by the signal peptidase complex (SPC) as soon as the lumenal domain of the translocating polypeptide is large enough to expose its cleavage site to the enzyme. The signal peptidase complex is possibly also involved in proteolytic events in the ER membrane other than the processing of the signal sequence, for example the further digestion of the cleaved signal peptide or the degradation of membrane proteins. Mammalian signal peptidase is as a complex of five different polypeptide chains. This family represents the 12 kDa subunit (SPC12).

CDC73_C	PF05179.13	1	149	CDC73 is an RNA polymerase II accessory factor [1], and forms part of the Paf1 complex that has roles in post-initiation events [2]. More specifically, crystal structure analysis shows the C-terminus to be a Ras-like domain that adopts a fold that is highly similar to GTPases of the Ras superfamily. The canonical nucleotide binding pocket is altered in CDC73, and there is no nucleotide ligand, but it contributes to histone methylation and Paf1C recruitment to active genes. Thus together with Rtf1 it combines to couple the Paf1 complex to elongating polymerase [3]. The family has been added to the P-loop clan on the basis of the topology of the b-stranded core, and its similarity to Ras.

MFAP1	PF06991.10	1	122	MFAP1 was first named for proteins associated with microfibrils which are an important component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of many tissues. For example, MFAP1 has been shown to be associated with elastin-like fibres at the base of Schlemm's canal endothelium cells, in the juxtacanalicular tissue, and in the uveal region [3]. Based on its role in the ECM and the proximity of the MFAP1 gene to FBN1 it was hypothesised that mutations in MFAP1 contributed to heritable diseases affecting microfibrils, Marfan syndrome [1] but this has now been shown not to be the case. MFAP1 has also been shown to interact directly with certain pre-mRNA processing factor proteins, Prps, which are also spliceosome components and is thus required for pre-mRNA processing. MAFP1 bound to Pr38 of yeast is necessary for cells in vivo to progress from G2 to M phase [2].

Due to its similarity to the TIR domain (Pfam:PF01582), the SEFIR region is thought to be involved in homotypic interactions with other SEFIR/TIR-domain-containing proteins.

SPC25	PF06703.10	1	175	This family consists of several microsomal signal peptidase 25 kDa subunit proteins. Translocation of polypeptide chains across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is triggered by signal sequences. Subsequently, signal recognition particle interacts with its membrane receptor and the ribosome-bound nascent chain is targeted to the ER where it is transferred into a protein-conducting channel. At some point, a second signal sequence recognition event takes place in the membrane and translocation of the nascent chain through the membrane occurs. The signal sequence of most secretory and membrane proteins is cleaved off at this stage. Cleavage occurs by the signal peptidase complex (SPC) as soon as the lumenal domain of the translocating polypeptide is large enough to expose its cleavage site to the enzyme. The signal peptidase complex is possibly also involved in proteolytic events in the ER membrane other than the processing of the signal sequence, for example the further digestion of the cleaved signal peptide or the degradation of membrane proteins. Mammalian signal peptidase is as a complex of five different polypeptide chains. This family represents the 25 kDa subunit (SPC25).

HUN	PF08729.9	1	46	HPC2 (Histone promoter control 2) is required for cell-cycle regulation of histone transcription [1]. It regulates transcription of the histone genes during the S-phase of the cell cycle by repressing transcription at other cell cycle stages. HPC2 mutants display synthetic interactions with FACT complex which allows RNA Pol II to elongate through nucleosomes [2]. Hpc2 is one of the proteins of one of the multi-subunit complexes that mediate replication- independent nucleosome assembly, along with histone chaperone proteins. the Hip4 sequence from SCH. pombe is an integral component of this complex that is required for transcriptional silencing at multiple loci [3]. HPC2, ubinuclein/yemanuclein, and the cell cycle regulator FLJ25778 share a conserved domain that is predicted to bind histone tails [4]. This domain is also referred to as the HRD or Hpc2-related domain.	HUN	Domain	622	50.2	39	6.53	Changed	HPC2 and ubinuclein domain	4ZBJ	0.883559919	52	-1.8	-3.5856573705

When HsbA was adsorbed on the hydrophobic PBSA surfaces, it promoted PBSA degradation via the CutL1 polyesterase. CutL1 interacts directly with HsbA attached to the hydrophobic QCM electrode surface. These results suggest that when HsbA is adsorbed onto the PBSA surface, it recruits CutL1, and that when CutL1 is accumulated on the PBSA surface, it stimulates PBSA degradation.

The exocyst complex is essential for many exocytic events, by tethering vesicles at the plasma membrane for fusion. In fission yeast, polarised exocytosis for growth relies on the combined action of the exocyst at cell poles and myosin-driven transport along actin cables [1].

Mammalian GPITransamidase consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U, all five of which are required for function. It is possible that Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T form a tightly associated core that is only weakly associated with PIG-U. The exact function of PIG-S is unclear [2].

Structurally, the fold resembles a pleckstrin homology fold, on of whose roles is to recruit and tether their host protein to the cell membrane; and although the surface charges of the ICln fold are not equivalent to those of the PH domain, ICln can be phosphorylated in vitro and the PH-nature of the domain may be the part involving it in the transposition from cytosol to cell membrane during cytotonic swelling [1].

Med13_C	PF06333.11	1	86	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants through fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species [1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Med13 is part of the ancillary kinase module, together with Med12, CDK8 and CycC, which in yeast is implicated in transcriptional repression, though most of this activity is likely attributable to the CDK8 kinase. The large Med12 and Med13 proteins are required for specific developmental processes in Drosophila, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans but their biochemical functions are not understood [4].

DDOST_48kD	PF03345.13	1	122	Members of this family are involved in asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. In particular, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (DDOST), also known as oligosaccharyltransferase EC:2.4.1.119, transfers the high-mannose sugar GlcNAc(2)-Man(9)-Glc(3) from a dolichol-linked donor to an asparagine acceptor in a consensus Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif. In most eukaryotes, the DDOST complex is composed of three subunits, which in humans are described as a 48kD subunit, ribophorin I, and ribophorin II. However, the yeast DDOST appears to consist of six subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta). The yeast beta subunit is a 45kD polypeptide, previously discovered as the Wbp1 protein, with known sequence similarity to the human 48kD subunit and the other orthologues. This family includes the 48kD-like subunits from several eukaryotes; it also includes the yeast DDOST beta subunit Wbp1.

Furthermore, like the yeast prototypes, the majority of the proteins also possess a proline/glutamine-rich segment upstream of the CYSTM module that is likely to form a polar, disordered head in the cytoplasm. The presence of an atypical well-conserved acidic residue at the C-terminal end of the TM helix suggests that this might interact with a positively charged moiety in the lipid head group. Consistently across the eukaryotes, the different versions of the CYSTM module appear to have roles in stress-response or stress-tolerance, and, more specifically, in resistance to deleterious substances, implying that these might be general functions of the whole family.

RRM_4	PF10598.8	0	41	The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is PrP8 which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa [1]. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences.

Blastomeres in mouse embryos lacking pescadillo arrest at morula stages of development, the nucleoli fail to differentiate and accumulation of ribosomes is inhibited. It has been proposed that in mammalian cells pescadillo is essential for ribosome biogenesis and nucleologenesis and that disruption to its function results in cell cycle arrest [1].

Slu7	PF11708.7	1	120	The spliceosome, an assembly of snRNAs (U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) and proteins, catalyses the excision of introns from pre-mRNAs in two successive trans-esterification reactions. Step 2 depends upon integral spliceosome constituents such as U5 snRNA and Prp8 and non-spliceosomal proteins Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22. ATP hydrolysis by the DEAH-box enzyme Prp16 promotes a conformational change in the spliceosome that leads to protection of the 3'ss from targeted RNase H cleavage. This change, which probably reflects binding of the 3'ss PyAG in the catalytic centre of the spliceosome, requires the ordered recruitment of Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 to the spliceosome. There is a close functional relationship between Prp8, Prp18, and Slu7, and Prp18 interacts with Slu7, so that together they recruit Prp22 to the spliceosome.

CAS_CSE1	PF03378.14	1	15	Mammalian cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS) proteins are homologous to the yeast chromosome-segregation protein, CSE1 [1]. This family aligns the C-terminal halves (approximately). CAS is involved in both cellular apoptosis and proliferation [2,3]. Apoptosis is inhibited in CAS-depleted cells, while the expression of CAS correlates to the degree of cellular proliferation. Like CSE1, it is essential for the mitotic checkpoint in the cell cycle (CAS depletion blocks the cell in the G2 phase), and has been shown to be associated with the microtubule network and the mitotic spindle [3], as is the protein MEK, which is thought to regulate the intracellular localisation (predominantly nuclear vs. predominantly cytosolic) of CAS. In the nucleus, CAS acts as a nuclear transport factor in the importin pathway [4]. The importin pathway mediates the nuclear transport of several proteins that are necessary for mitosis and further progression. CAS is therefore thought to affect the cell cycle through its effect on the nuclear transport of these proteins [4]. Since apoptosis also requires the nuclear import of several proteins (such as P53 and transcription factors), it has been suggested that CAS also enables apoptosis by facilitating the nuclear import of at least a subset of these essential proteins [5].

Bystin	PF05291.10	1	100	Trophinin and tastin form a cell adhesion molecule complex that potentially mediates an initial attachment of the blastocyst to uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation. Trophinin and tastin bind to an intermediary cytoplasmic protein called bystin. Bystin may be involved in implantation and trophoblast invasion because bystin is found with trophinin and tastin in the cells at human implantation sites and also in the intermediate trophoblasts at invasion front in the placenta from early pregnancy [1]. This family also includes the yeast protein ENP1. ENP1 is an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is localised in the nucleus [2]. It is thought that ENP1 plays a direct role in the early steps of rRNA processing as enp1 defective yeast cannot synthesise 20S pre-rRNA and hence 18S rRNA, which leads to reduced formation of 40S ribosomal subunits [3].

Proteasom_Rpn13	PF04683.12	1	147	This family was thought originally to be involved in cell-adhesion [1,2], but the members are now known to be proteasome subunit Rpn13, a novel ubiquitin receptor. The 26S proteasome is a huge macromolecular protein-degradation machine consisting of a proteolytically active 20S core, in the form of four disc-like proteins, and one or two 19S regulatory particles. The regulatory particle(s) sit on the top and or bottom of the core, de-ubiquitinate the substrate peptides, unfold them and guide them into the narrow channel through the centre of the core. Rpn13 and its homologues dock onto the regulatory particle through the N-terminal region which binds Rpn2. The C-terminal part of the domain binds de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 and enhances its isopeptidase activity. Rpn13 binds ubiquitin via a conserved amino-terminal region called the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin, termed Pru, domain [4]. The domain forms two contiguous anti-parallel beta-sheets with a configuration similar to the pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD) fold [5]. Rpn13's ability to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously supports evidence of its role as a ubiquitin receptor. Finally, when complexed to di-ubiquitin, via the Pru, and Uch37 via the C-terminal part, it frees up the distal ubiquitin for de-ubiquitination by the Uch37 [5].

Glyco_transf_54	PF04666.12	1	20	The complex-type of oligosaccharides are synthesised through elongation by glycosyltransferases after trimming of the precursor oligosaccharides transferred to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnTs) take part in the formation of branches in the biosynthesis of complex-type sugar chains. In vertebrates, six GnTs, designated as GnT-I to -VI, which catalyse the transfer of GlcNAc to the core mannose residues of Asn-linked sugar chains, have been identified. GnT-IV (EC:2.4.1.145) catalyses the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the GlcNAc1-2Man1-3 arm of core oligosaccharide [Gn2(22)core oligosaccharide] and forms GlcNAc1-4(GlcNAc1-2)Man1-3 structure on the core oligosaccharide (Gn3(2,4,2)core oligosaccharide). In some members the conserved region occupies all but the very for N-terminal, where there is a signal sequence on all members. For other members the conserved region does not occupy the entire protein but is still to the N-terminus of the protein [1].

MINDY_DUB	PF04424.12	1	107	This entry represents a group of deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes known as the MINDY family (MIU-containing novel DUB). Ubiquitin (Ub) is released one molecule at a time from the distal end of proteins with Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Long polyubiquitin chains are preferred. The catalytic Cys and His residues have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis, as has the Gln that participates in formation of the oxyanion hole during catalysis. Despite the structural similarity to papain-like cysteine peptidases, a residue corresponding to the Asn that orientates the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His has not been identified. Members of the MINDY family of DUBs contain an MIU (motif interacting with Ub) motif, which is a helical motif that binds mono-Ub [1].

The family displays limited sequence similarity to DEAD-box RNA helicases, having alternative residues at the Walker A and DEAD-box sites, but conservation of structural and other key residues [1]. The domain is required and sufficient for the interaction of Utp25 with Utp3. UTP25 interacts with nucleolar protein Nop19 in S. cerevisiae, and Nop19p is essential for the incorporation of Utp25p into pre-ribosomes [2].

Ribophorin_I	PF04597.13	1	189	Ribophorin I is an essential subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which is also known as Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase, (EC:2.4.1.119). OST catalyses the transfer of an oligosaccharide from dolichol pyrophosphate to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as they are translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribophorin I and OST48 are though to be responsible for OST catalytic activity [1]. Both yeast and mammalian proteins are glycosylated but the sites are not conserved. Glycosylation may contribute towards general solubility but is unlikely to be involved in a specific biochemical function [2] Most family members are predicted to have a transmembrane helix at the C terminus of this region.

ANAPC5	PF12862.6	1	26	Apc5 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) which is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase that mediates the proteolysis of cell cycle proteins in mitosis and G1. Apc5, although it does not harbour a classical RNA binding domain, Apc5 binds the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which directly binds the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of growth factor 2 mRNA. PABP was found to enhance IRES-mediated translation, whereas Apc5 over-expression counteracted this effect. In addition to its association with the APC/C complex, Apc5 binds much heavier complexes and co-sediments with the ribosomal fraction [1,2]. The N-terminus of Afi1 serves to stabilise the union between Apc4 and Apc5, both of which lie towards the bottom-front of the APC [3]. This region of the Apc5 member proteins carries a TPR-like motif.	ANAPC5	Domain	710	88.4	25	13.91	Changed	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5	4UI9;4UI9	0.9338867783	91	-2.6	-2.9411764706

CLN3	PF02487.16	1	95	This is a family of proteins from the CLN3 gene. A mis-sense mutation of glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 295 in the human protein (Swiss:Q13286) has been implicated in Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) [1]. Batten disease is characterised by the accumulation of autofluorescent material in the lysosomes of most cells. Members of this family are transmembrane proteins functional in pre-vacuolar compartments. The protein in Sch.pombe is found to be localised to the vacuolar membrane, and a lack of functional protein clearly affects the size and pH of the vacuole. Thus the protein is necessary for vacuolar homeostasis [2]. It is important for localisation of late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, and it interacts with motor components driving both plus and minus end microtubular trafficking: tubulin, dynactin, dynein and kinesin-2 [3].

The enzyme plays a regulatory role in a variety of physiological events in eukaryotes and also functions as an exotoxin in particular bacteria. This C-terminal tail of the enzyme is highly conserved across all species and may play a role in the interaction of the enzyme with the plasma membranes [4].

Spt4	PF06093.12	1	36	This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription elongation Spt4 proteins as well as archaebacterial RpoE2 [2]. Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles [1]. RpoE2 is one of 13 subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved in [3]. The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of the transcription elongation machinery.

CLU	PF13236.5	1	120	The CLU domain (CLUstered mitochondria) is a eukaryotic domain found in proteins from fungi, protozoa, plants to humans. It is required for correct functioning of the mitochondria and mitochondrial transport [1,2] although the exact function of the domain is unknown [4]. In Dictyostelium the full-length protein is required for a very late step in fission of the outer mitochondrial membrane [2] suggesting that mitochondria are transported along microtubules, as in mammalian cells, rather than along actin filaments, as in budding yeast [1]. Disruption of the protein-impaired cytokinesis and caused mitochondria to cluster at the cell centre [1]. It is likely that CLU functions in a novel pathway that positions mitochondria within the cell based on their physiological state. Disruption of the CLU pathway may enhance oxidative damage, alter gene expression, cause mitochondria to cluster at microtubule plus ends, and lead eventually to mitochondrial failure [3].

This domain has a role in interaction with regions of upstream promoter DNA and the nascent RNA chain, leading to the processivity of the enzyme [1]. In order to make mRNA transcripts the RNA polymerase undergoes a transition from the initiation phase (which only makes short fragments of RNA) to an elongation phase. This domain undergoes a structural change in the transition from initiation to elongation phase. The structural change results in abolition of the promoter binding site, creation of a channel accommodating the heteroduplex in the active site and formation of an exit tunnel which the RNA transcript passes through after peeling off the heteroduplex [2].

Methyltransf_PK	PF05891.11	1	7	This protein is expressed in the tail neuron PVT and in uterine cells in C. elegans [worm-base]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this is AdoMet dependent proline di-methyltransferase. This enzyme catalyses the di-methylation of ribosomal proteins Rpl12 and Rps25 at N-terminal proline residues. The methyltransferases described here specifically recognise the N-terminal X-Pro-Lys sequence motif, and they may account for nearly all previously described eukaryotic protein N-terminal methylation reactions. A number of other yeast and human proteins also share the recognition motif and may be similarly modified [1]. As with other methyltransferases, this family carries the characteristic GxGxG motif.

It is found in both the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) [1]. CIAPIN1 is found to be up-regulated in hepatocellular cancer, is considered to be a downstream effector of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras signalling pathway, and is essential in mouse definitive haematopoiesis [2]. Dre2 has been found to interact with the yeast reductase Tah18, forming a tight cytosolic complex implicated in the response to high levels of oxidative stress [3].

PTPlike_phytase	PF14566.5	1	48	Inositol hexakisphosphate, often called phytate, is found in abundance in seeds and acting as an inorganic phosphate reservoir. Phytases are phosphatases that hydrolyze phytate to less-phosphorylated myo-inositol derivatives and inorganic phosphate. The active-site sequence (HCXXGXGR) of the phytase identified from the gut micro-organism Selenomonas ruminantium forms a loop (P loop) at the base of a substrate binding pocket that is characteristic of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The depth of this pocket is an important determinant of the substrate specificity of PTPs. In humans this enzyme is thought to aid bone mineralization and salvage the inositol moiety prior to apoptosis [3].

In the mouse, Nrap is ubiquitously expressed and is specifically localised in the nucleolus [1]. Nrap is a large nucleolar protein (of more than 1000 amino acids). Nrap appears to be associated with ribosome biogenesis by interacting with pre-rRNA primary transcript [1]. This domain has a nucleotidyltransferase structure.

COPI_C	PF06957.10	1	34	This family represents the C-terminus (approximately 500 residues) of the eukaryotic coatomer alpha subunit. Coatomer (COPI) is a large cytosolic protein complex which forms a coat around vesicles budding from the Golgi apparatus. Such coatomer-coated vesicles have been proposed to play a role in many distinct steps of intracellular transport [1]. Note that many family members also contain the Pfam:PF04053 domain.

Rtf2	PF04641.11	1	18	It is vital for effective cell-replication that replication is not stalled at any point by, for instance, damaged bases. Replication termination factor 2 (Rtf2) stabilizes the replication fork stalled at the site-specific replication barrier RTS1 by preventing replication restart until completion of DNA synthesis by a converging replication fork initiated at a flanking origin. The RTS1 element terminates replication forks that are moving in the cen2-distal direction while allowing forks moving in the cen2-proximal direction to pass through the region. Rtf2 contains a C2HC2 motif related to the C3HC4 RING-finger motif, and would appear to fold up, creating a RING finger-like structure but forming only one functional Zn2+ ion-binding site [1]. This domain is also found at the N-terminus of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 4, a divergent cyclophilin family [2].

Mpp10	PF04006.11	1	55	This family includes proteins related to Mpp10 (M phase phosphoprotein 10). The U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) is required for three cleavage events that generate the mature 18S rRNA from the pre-rRNA. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, depletion of Mpp10, a U3 snoRNP-specific protein, halts 18S rRNA production and impairs cleavage at the three U3 snoRNP-dependent sites [3].

The Toll family of receptors - TLRs - plays an essential role in innate recognition of microbial products, the first line of defence against bacterial infection [1]. PRAT4A influences the subcellular distribution and the strength of TLR responses and alters the relative activity of each TLR. PRAT4B regulates TLR4 trafficking to the cell surface and the extent of its expression there [2][3]. TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the most immuno-stimulatory glycolipids constituting the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria.

BLM10_mid	PF16507.4	0	92	The ordered regions of the yeast BLM10 or PA200 (human homologue), full-length protein encode 32 HEAT repeat (HR)-like modules [1], each comprising two helices joined by a turn, with adjacent repeats connected by a linker. Whereas a standard HEAT repeat is composed of ~50 residues, the BLM10 HEAT repeats are highly variable. The length of helices ranges from 8 to 35 residues, turns range from 2 to 87 residues, and linkers range from 1 to 88 residues, with the longest linker, between HR21 and HR22, containing additional secondary structures (two strands and three helices). BLM10_mid is the middle ordered region of the three in BLM10. BLM10 is found to surround the proteasome entry pore in the 1.2 MDa complex of proteasome and BLM10 to form a largely closed dome that is expected to restrict access of potential substrates. Thus Blm10 and PA200 are predominantly nuclear and stimulate the degradation of model peptides, although they do not appear to stimulate the degradation of proteins, recognise ubiquitin, or utilise ATP [2].

The Mon1/Ccz1 complex is conserved in eukaryotic evolution and members of this family (previously known as DUF254) are distant homologues to domains of known structure that assemble into cargo vesicle adapter (AP) complexes [5]. [3] describes orthologues in Fugu rubripes.	Mon1	Family	793	356.8	29	70.96	Changed	Trafficking protein Mon1		0.440510365	381	-24.2	-6.7825112108

HABP4_PAI-RBP1	PF04774.14	1	86	This family includes the HABP4 family of hyaluronan-binding proteins, and the PAI-1 mRNA-binding protein, PAI-RBP1. HABP4 has been observed to bind hyaluronan (a glucosaminoglycan), but it is not known whether this is its primary role in vivo. It has also been observed to bind RNA, but with a lower affinity than that for hyaluronan [1]. PAI-1 mRNA-binding protein specifically binds the mRNA of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and is thought to be involved in regulation of mRNA stability [2]. However, in both cases, the sequence motifs predicted to be important for ligand binding are not conserved throughout the family, so it is not known whether members of this family share a common function.

Atg14	PF10186.8	1	29	The Atg14 or Apg14 proteins are hydrophilic proteins with a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa, and have a coiled-coil motif at the N terminus region. Yeast cells with mutant Atg14 are defective not only in autophagy but also in sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar-soluble hydrolase, to the vacuole. Subcellular fractionation indicate that Apg14p and Apg6p are peripherally associated with a membrane structure(s). Apg14p was co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p, suggesting that they form a stable protein complex. These results imply that Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions: in the autophagic process and in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. Apg14p may be a component specifically required for the function of Apg6/Vps30p through the autophagic pathway [1]. There are 17 auto-phagosomal component proteins which are categorized into six functional units, one of which is the AS-PI3K complex (Vps30/Atg6 and Atg14). The AS-PI3K complex and the Atg2-Atg18 complex are essential for nucleation, and the specific function of the AS-PI3K apparently is to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). The localisation of this complex at the PAS is controlled by Atg14 [2]. Autophagy mediates the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, protein aggregation, and pathogen invasion in humans, and malfunction of autophagy has been implicated in multiple human diseases including cancer. This effect seems to be mediated through direct interaction of the human Atg14 with Beclin 1 in the human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III complex [3].

V-ATPases consist of peripheral (V1) and membrane integral (V0) heteromultimeric complexes. The G subunit is part of the V1 subunit, but is also thought to be strongly attached to the V0 complex.

Nup160	PF11715.7	1	20	Nup120 is conserved from fungi to plants to humans, and is homologous with the Nup160 of vertebrates. The nuclear core complex, or NPC, mediates macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope. Deletion of the NUP120 gene causes clustering of NPCs at one side of the nuclear envelope, moderate nucleolar fragmentation and slower cell growth [1]. The vertebrate NPC is estimated to contain between 30 and 60 different proteins. most of which are not known. Two important ones in creating the nucleoporin basket are Nup98 and Nup153, and Nup120, in conjunction with Nup 133, interacts with these two and itself plays a role in mRNA export [2]. Nup160, Nup133, Nup96, and Nup107 are all targets of phosphorylation. The phosphorylation sites are clustered mainly at the N-terminal regions of these proteins, which are predicted to be natively disordered. The entire Nup107-160 sub-complex is stable throughout the cell cycle, thus it seems unlikely that phosphorylation affects interactions within the Nup107-160 sub-complex, but rather that it regulates the association of the sub-complex with the NPC and other proteins [2].

Vac14_Fab1_bd	PF12755.6	1	33	Vac14 is a scaffold for the Fab1 kinase complex, a complex that allows for the dynamic interconversion of PI3P and PI(3,5)P2p (phosphoinositide phosphate (PIP) lipids, that are generated transiently on the cytoplasmic face of selected intracellular membranes). This interconversion is regulated by at least five proteins in yeast: the lipid kinase Fab1p, lipid phosphatase Fig4p, the Fab1p activator Vac7p, the Fab1p inhibitor Atg18p, and Vac14p, a protein required for the activity of both Fab1p and Fig4p. This domain appears to be the one responsible for binding to Fab1. The full length Vac14 in yeasts is likely to be a protein carrying a succession of HEAT repeats, most of which have now degenerated. This regulatory system is crucial for the proper functioning of the mammalian nervous system.

HOOK	PF05622.11	1	21	This family consists of several HOOK1, 2 and 3 proteins from different eukaryotic organisms. The different members of the human gene family are HOOK1, HOOK2 and HOOK3. Different domains have been identified in the three human HOOK proteins, and it was demonstrated that the highly conserved NH2-domain mediates attachment to microtubules, whereas the central coiled-coil motif mediates homodimerisation and the more divergent C-terminal domains are involved in binding to specific organelles (organelle-binding domains). It has been demonstrated that endogenous HOOK3 binds to Golgi membranes [1], whereas both HOOK1 and HOOK2 are localised to discrete but unidentified cellular structures. In mice the Hook1 gene is predominantly expressed in the testis. Hook1 function is necessary for the correct positioning of microtubular structures within the haploid germ cell. Disruption of Hook1 function in mice causes abnormal sperm head shape and fragile attachment of the flagellum to the sperm head [2].

The enzyme catalyses the sequential removal of two alpha-1,3-linked glucose residues in the second step of N-linked oligosaccharide processing [1]. The beta subunit is required for the solubility and stability of the heterodimeric enzyme, and is involved in retaining the enzyme within the endoplasmic reticulum [1]. Mutations in the gene coding for PRKCSH have been found to be involved in the development of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), but the precise role the protein has in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown [2]. This family also includes an ER sensor for misfolded glycoproteins and is therefore likely to be a generic sugar binding domain.

Proline 3-hydroxylase hydroxylates proline at position 3, the first of a 2-OG oxygenase catalysing oxidation of a free alpha-amino acid. The structure of proline 3-hydroxylase contains the conserved motifs present in other 2-OG oxygenases including a jelly roll strand core and residues binding iron and 2-oxoglutarate, consistent with divergent evolution within the extended family. This family represent the arginine, asparagine and proline hydroxylases. The aspartyl/asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase (EC:1.14.11.16) specifically hydroxylates one aspartic or asparagine residue in certain epidermal growth factor-like domains of a number of proteins [1].

Cnd2	PF05786.13	1	55	This family consists of several Barren protein homologues from several eukaryotic organisms. In Drosophila Barren (barr) is required for sister-chromatid segregation in mitosis. barr encodes a novel protein that is present in proliferating cells and has homologues in yeast and human. Mitotic defects in barr embryos become apparent during cycle 16, resulting in a loss of PNS and CNS neurons. Centromeres move apart at the metaphase-anaphase transition and Cyclin B is degraded, but sister chromatids remain connected, resulting in chromatin bridging. Barren protein localises to chromatin throughout mitosis. Colocalisation and biochemical experiments indicate that Barren associates with Topoisomerase II throughout mitosis and alters the activity of Topoisomerase II. It has been suggested that this association is required for proper chromosomal segregation by facilitating the decatenation of chromatids at anaphase [1]. This family forms one of the three non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits of the mitotic condensation complex along with Cnd1 and Cnd3 [4].

Loss of KAT11 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation, both on bulk histone and on chromatin [1]. KAT11 and H3K56 acetylation appear to correlate with actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of Pol II in yeast [1].

Perhaps the best known members are secreted snake venoms, but also found in secreted pancreatic and membrane-associated forms. Structure is all-alpha, with two core disulfide-linked helices and a calcium-binding loop. This alignment represents the major family of PLA2s.

Fascin	PF06268.12	1	17	This family consists of several eukaryotic fascin or singed proteins. The fascins are a structurally unique and evolutionarily conserved group of actin cross-linking proteins. Fascins function in the organisation of two major forms of actin-based structures: dynamic, cortical cell protrusions and cytoplasmic microfilament bundles. The cortical structures, which include filopodia, spikes, lamellipodial ribs, oocyte microvilli and the dendrites of dendritic cells, have roles in cell-matrix adhesion, cell interactions and cell migration, whereas the cytoplasmic actin bundles appear to participate in cell architecture [1]. Dictyostelium hisactophilin, another actin-binding protein, is a submembranous pH sensor that signals slight changes of the H+ concentration to actin by inducing actin polymerisation and binding to microfilaments only at pH values below seven [1]. Members of this family are histidine rich, typically contain the repeated motif of HHXH [3].

EB1	PF03271.16	1	167	This motif is found at the C-terminus of proteins that are related to the EB1 protein. The EB1 proteins contain an N-terminal CH domain Pfam:PF00307. The human EB1 protein was originally discovered as a protein interacting with the C-terminus of the APC protein. This interaction is often disrupted in colon cancer, due to deletions affecting the APC C-terminus. Several EB1 orthologues are also included in this family. The interaction between EB1 and APC has been shown to have a potent synergistic effect on microtubule polymerisation. Neither of EB1 or APC alone has this effect. It is thought that EB1 targets APC to the + ends of microtubules, where APC promotes microtubule polymerisation. This process is regulated by APC phosphorylation by Cdc2, which disrupts APC-EB1 binding. Human EB1 protein can functionally substitute for the yeast EB1 homologue Mal3. In addition, Mal3 can substitute for human EB1 in promoting microtubule polymerisation with APC.

The HELP motif is approximately 60-70 amino acids in length and is conserved amongst metazoans. Although the HELP motif is hydrophobic, there is no evidence that EMAP-Like Proteins are membrane-associated. All members of the EMAP-Like Protein family, identified to-date, are constructed with an amino terminal HELP motif followed by a WD domain [1]. In C. elegans, EMAP-Like Protein-1 (ELP-1) is required for touch sensation indicating that ELP-1 may play a role in mechanosensation [2].

PTG also binds the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) and localises it to glycogen. Subsets of similar interactions have been observed with several other members of this family, such as the yeast PIG1, PIG2, GAC1 and GIP2 proteins. While the precise function of these proteins is not known, they may serve a scaffold function, bringing together the key enzymes in glycogen metabolism. This family is a carbohydrate binding domain.

JHBP	PF06585.10	1	247	This family consists of several insect-specific haemolymph juvenile hormone binding proteins (JHBP). Juvenile hormone regulates embryogenesis, maintains the status quo of larval development and stimulates reproductive maturation in the adult insect. JH is transported from the sites of its synthesis to target tissues by a haemolymph carrier called juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHBP). JHBP protects the JH molecules from hydrolysis by non-specific esterases present in the insect haemolymph [1]. The crystal structure of the JHBP from Galleria mellonella shows an unusual fold consisting of a long alpha-helix wrapped in a much curved antiparallel beta-sheet. The folding pattern for this structure closely resembles that found in some tandem-repeat mammalian lipid-binding and bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, with a similar organisation of the major cavity and a disulfide bond linking the long helix and the beta-sheet. It would appear that JHBP forms two cavities, only one of which, the one near the N- and C-termini, binds the hormone; binding induces a conformational change, of unknown significance [1].

There are three sub-families - all share an N-terminal PITP-like domain, whose sequence is highly conserved. It is described as consisting of three regions. The N-terminal region is thought to bind the lipid and contains two helices and an eight-stranded, mostly antiparallel beta-sheet. An intervening loop region, which is thought to play a role in protein-protein interactions, separates this from the C-terminal region, which exhibits the greatest sequence variation and may be involved in membrane binding. PITP alpha (Swiss:Q00169) has a 16-fold greater affinity for PI than PC. Together with PITP beta (Swiss:P48739), it is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues [1].

The TFIIA heterotrimer is an essential general transcription initiation factor for the expression of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Together with TFIID, TFIIA binds to the promoter region; this is the first step in the formation of a pre-initiation complex (PIC). Binding of the rest of the transcription machinery follows this step [1]. After initiation, the PIC does not completely dissociate from the promoter. Some components, including TFIIA, remain attached and re-initiate a subsequent round of transcription.

ARD	PF03079.13	1	10	The two acireductone dioxygenase enzymes (ARD and ARD', previously known as E-2 and E-2') from Klebsiella pneumoniae share the same amino acid sequence Swiss:Q9ZFE7, but bind different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD' binds Fe2+. ARD and ARD' can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion. The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions [1,2]. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalysed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels [1,2]. This family also contains other members, whose functions are not well characterised.

Ndr	PF03096.13	1	10	This family consists of proteins from different gene families: Ndr1/RTP/Drg1, Ndr2, and Ndr3. Their similarity was previously noted [1]. The precise molecular and cellular function of members of this family is still unknown. Yet, they are known to be involved in cellular differentiation events. The Ndr1 group was the first to be discovered. Their expression is repressed by the proto-oncogenes N-myc and c-myc, and in line with this observation, Ndr1 protein expression is down-regulated in neoplastic cells, and is reactivated when differentiation is induced by chemicals such as retinoic acid. Ndr2 and Ndr3 expression is not under the control of N-myc or c-myc. Ndr1 expression is also activated by several chemicals: tunicamycin and homocysteine induce Ndr1 in human umbilical endothelial cells; nickel induces Ndr1 in several cell types. Members of this family are found in wide variety of multicellular eukaryotes, including an Ndr1 type protein in Helianthus annuus (sunflower), known as Sf21 Swiss:O23969. Interestingly, the highest scoring matches in the noise are all alpha/beta hydrolases Pfam:PF00561, suggesting that this family may have an enzymatic function (Bateman A pers. obs.).

However, despite its binding to UGTR and that its mRNA is up-regulated in extended asphyxia, the function of the protein and hence of this region of it is unknown [2].

The human UFD1 gene is expressed at high levels during embryogenesis, especially in the eyes and in the inner ear primordia and is thought to be important in the determination of ectoderm-derived structures, including neural crest cells. In addition, this gene is deleted in the CATCH-22 (cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate and hypocalcaemia with deletions on chromosome 22) syndrome. This clinical syndrome is associated with a variety of developmental defects, all characterised by microdeletions on 22q11.2. Two such developmental defects are the DiGeorge syndrome OMIM:188400, and the velo-cardio- facial syndrome OMIM:145410. Several of the abnormalities associated with these conditions are thought to be due to defective neural crest cell differentiation [2].

Suf	PF05843.13	1	20	This family consists of several eukaryotic suppressor of forked (Suf) like proteins. The Drosophila melanogaster Suppressor of forked [Su(f)] protein shares homology with the yeast RNA14 protein and the 77-kDa subunit of human cleavage stimulation factor, which are proteins involved in mRNA 3' end formation. This suggests a role for Su(f) in mRNA 3' end formation in Drosophila. The su(f) gene produces three transcripts; two of them are polyadenylated at the end of the transcription unit, and one is a truncated transcript, polyadenylated in intron 4. It is thought that su(f) plays a role in the regulation of poly(A) site utilisation and an important role of the GU-rich sequence for this regulation to occur [1].

CD20	PF04103.14	1	41	This family includes the CD20 protein and the beta subunit of the high affinity receptor for IgE Fc. The high affinity receptor for IgE is a tetrameric structure consisting of a single IgE-binding alpha subunit, a single beta subunit, and two disulfide-linked gamma subunits. The alpha subunit of Fc epsilon RI and most Fc receptors are homologous members of the Ig superfamily. By contrast, the beta and gamma subunits from Fc epsilon RI are not homologous to the Ig superfamily. Both molecules have four putative transmembrane segments and a probably topology where both amino- and carboxy termini protrude into the cytoplasm [1]. This family also includes LR8 like proteins from humans, mice and rats. The function of the human LR8 protein is unknown although it is known to be strongly expressed in the lung fibroblasts [2]. This family also includes sarcospan is a transmembrane component of dystrophin-associated glycoprotein. Loss of the sarcoglycan complex and sarcospan alone is sufficient to cause muscular dystrophy. The role of the sarcoglycan complex and sarcospan is thought to be to strengthen the dystrophin axis connecting the basement membrane with the cytoskeleton [3].

Proteins in this family are typically between 247 and 307 amino acids in length. These proteins function as a chaperone for the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. A number of studies including very recent ones have revealed that assembly of its 20S catalytic core particle is an ordered process that involves several conserved proteasome assembly chaperones (PACs). Two heterodimeric chaperones, PAC1-PAC2 and PAC3-PAC4, promote the assembly of rings composed of seven alpha subunits [4].

This domain binds to nonmethyl-CpG dinucleotides. The domain is characterised by two repeats [3], and shows a peculiar internal duplication in which the second unit is inserted into the first one [4]. Each of these units is characterised by four conserved cysteines, displaying a CXXCXXCX(n)C motif that chelate a Zn+2 ion. The DNA binding interface has been identified by NMR [3]. In eukaryotes, the CXXC domain is found in stramenopiles, plants and metazoans. Plants possess a mono-CXXC domain that is present in distinct chromatin proteins [4].

zf-U1	PF06220.11	1	11	This family consists of several U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1-C) proteins. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5' splice site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5' ss is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5' ss. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5' ss helps to stabilise U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator [1]. This domain is probably a zinc-binding. It is found in multiple copies in some members of the family.	zf-U1	Domain	1191	36.6	40	14.81	Changed	U1 zinc finger	2VRD;3CW1;4PJO	0.9728610511	38	-1.4	-3.825136612

This domain is the catalytic N-terminal proline-rich region of the protein. The downstream region is a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain which is found to be crucial for cellular localisation, but not necessary for the enzyme activity [1]. H-REV107-like proteins are homologous to lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of the sn-1 acyl group of phosphatidylcholine to all-trans-retinol and forming a retinyl ester [2].

Lectin_leg-like	PF03388.12	1	8	Lectins are structurally diverse proteins that bind to specific carbohydrates. This family includes the VIP36 Swiss:P49256 and ERGIC-53 Swiss:P49257 lectins. These two proteins were the first recognised members of a family of animal lectins similar (19-24%) to the leguminous plant lectins [1]. The alignment for this family aligns residues lying towards the N-terminus, where the similarity of VIP36 and ERGIC-53 is greatest. However, while Fiedler and Simons [1] identified these proteins as a new family of animal lectins, our alignment also includes yeast sequences. ERGIC-53 is a 53kD protein, localised to the intermediate region between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (ER-Golgi-Intermediate Compartment, ERGIC). It was identified as a calcium-dependent, mannose-specific lectin [2]. Its dysfunction has been associated with combined factors V and VIII deficiency OMIM:227300 OMIM:601567, suggesting an important and substrate-specific role for ERGIC-53 in the glycoprotein- secreting pathway [2,3].

It catalyses the direct formation of Neu5Ac (the most common sialic acid) by condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). This reaction has only been observed in prokaryotes; eukaryotes synthesise the 9-phosphate form, Neu5Ac-9-P, and utilise ManNAc-6-P instead of ManNAc.

Sortilin_C	PF15901.4	1	349	Sortilin_C is the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of sortilin, a Vps10p domain-containing family of proteins [1,2]. Most sortilin is expressed within intracellular compartments, where it chaperones diverse ligands, including proBDNF and acid hydrolases. The sortilin cytoplasmic tail is homologous to mannose 6-phosphate receptor and is required for the intracellular trafficking of cargo proteins via interactions with distinct adaptor molecules [3,4]. In addition to mediating lysosomal targeting of specific acid hydrolases, the sortilin cytoplasmic tail also directs trafficking of BDNF to the secretory pathway in neurons, where it can be released in response to depolarisation to modulate cell survival and synaptic plasticity [5].

Members of this family mediate sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis and meiosis, as part of the cohesin complex [1]. Cohesion is necessary for homologous recombination (including double-strand break repair) and correct chromatid segregation. These proteins may also be involved in chromosome condensation.

Sdh5	PF03937.15	1	298	This family includes the highly conserved mitochondrial and bacterial proteins Sdh5/SDHAF2/SdhE. Both yeast and human Sdh5/SDHAF2 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Mutational inactivation of Sdh5 confers tumor susceptibility in humans [1]. Bacterial homologues of Sdh5, termed SdhE, are functionally conserved being required for the flavinylation of SdhA and succinate dehydrogenase activity. Like Sdh5, SdhE interacts with SdhA. Furthermore, SdhE was characterised as a FAD co-factor chaperone that directly binds FAD to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SdhE/Sdh5 proteins evolved only once in an ancestral alpha-proteobacteria prior to the evolution of the mitochondria and now remain in subsequent descendants including eukaryotic mitochondria and the alpha, beta and gamma proteobacteria [2]. This family was previously annotated in Pfam as being a divergent TPR repeat but structural evidence has indicated this is not true. The E. coli protein, YgfY also acts as the antitoxin to the membrane-bound toxin family Cpta, Pfam:PF13166, whose E. coli member YgfX, expressed from the same operon as YgfY [3].

LANCL1 (P40 seven-transmembrane-domain protein) and LANCL2 (testes-specific adriamycin sensitivity protein) are thought to be peptide-modifying enzyme components in eukaryotic cells. Both proteins are produced in large quantities in the brain and testes and may have role in the immune surveillance of these organs [1].

WSD	PF15613.5	1	87	This family represents the combined alpha-helical module found in diverse eukaryotic chromatin proteins [1]. Based on the Ioc3 structure, the N-terminus of this module is inferred to interact with nucleosomal linker DNA and the SLIDE domain of ISWI proteins [1,2]. The resulting complex forms a protein ruler that measures out the spacing between two adjacent nucleosomes [2]. The acidic residue from the GxD signature at the N-terminus is a major determinant of the interaction between the ISWI and WHIM motifs. The N-terminal portion also contacts the inter-nucleosomal linker DNA. The module shows a great domain architectural diversity and is often combined with other modified histone peptide recognizing and DNA binding domains, some of which discriminate methylated DNA. The WSD module constitutes the inter-nucleosomal linker DNA binding site in the major groove of DNA [1], and was first identified as WSD [3], the D-TOX E motif of plant homeodomains homologous with the mutant transcription factor causing Williams-Beuren syndrome in association with the DDT-domain.

This domain is separated from the MH1 domain by a non-conserved linker region. The MH2 domain mediates interaction with a wide variety of proteins and provides specificity and selectivity to Smad function and also is critical for mediating interactions in Smad oligomers. Unlike MH1, MH2 does not bind DNA. The well-studied MH2 domain of Smad4 is composed of five alpha helices and three loops enclosing a beta sandwich. Smads are involved in the propagation of TGF-beta signals by direct association with the TGF-beta receptor kinase which phosphorylates the last two Ser of a conserved 'SSXS' motif located at the C-terminus of MH2 [1-3].

SAD_SRA	PF02182.16	1	195	The domain goes by several names including SAD [1], SRA [2] and YDG [3]. It adopts a beta barrel, modified PUA-like, fold that is widely present in eukaryotic chromatin proteins and in bacteria [4]. Versions of this domain are known to bind hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotides and also other 5mC containing dinucleotides. The domain binds DNA by flipping out the methylated cytosine base from the DNA double helix [5].The conserved tyrosine and aspartate residues and a glycine rich patch are critical for recognition of the flipped out base [4][5]. Mammalian UHRF1 that contains this domain plays an important role in maintenance of methylation at CpG dinucleotides by recruiting DNMT1 to hemimethylated sites associated with replication forks [2]. The SAD/SRA domain has been combined with other domains involved in the ubiquitin pathway on multiple occasions and such proteins link recognition of DNA methylation to chromatin-protein ubiquitination [4]. The domain is also found in species that lack DNA methylation, such as certain apicomplexans, suggestive of other DNA-binding modes or functions [4]. A highly derived and distinct version of the domain is also found in fungi where it is fused to AlkB-type 2OGFeDO domains [6]. In bacteria, the domain is usually fused or associated with restriction endonucleases, many of which target methylated or hemi-methylated DNA [4].

ArgoMid	PF16487.4	1	34	The ArgoMid domain is found to be part of the Piwi-lobe of the argonaute proteins. It is composed of a parallel four-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by four alpha-helices and two additional short alpha-helices. It most closely resembles the amino terminal tryptic core of the E.coli lactose repressor. There is an extensive interface between the Mid and the Piwi domains. The conserved C-terminal half or the Mid has extensive interactions with Piwi, with a deep basic pocket on the surface of the `Mid adjacent to the interface with Piwi. The Mid carries a binding pocket for the 5' phosphate overhang of the guide strand of DNA [1]. The N, Mid, and Piwi domains form a base upon which the PAZ domain sits, resembling a duck. The 5' phosphate and the U1 base are held in place by a conserved network of interactions from protein residues of the Mid and Piwi domains in order to place the guide uniquely in the proper position observed in all Argonaute-RNA complexes [2].

Ist1	PF03398.13	1	134	ESCRT-I, -II, and -III are endosomal sorting complexes required for transporting proteins and carry out cargo sorting and vesicle formation in the multivesicular bodies, MVBs, pathway. These complexes are transiently recruited from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membrane where they bind transmembrane proteins previously marked for degradation by mono-ubiquitination. Assembly of ESCRT-III, a complex composed of at least four subunits (Vps2, Vps24, Vps20, Snf7), is intimately linked with MVB vesicle formation, its disassembly being an essential step in the MVB vesicle formation, a reaction that is carried out by Vps4, an AAA-type ATPase. The family Ist1 is a regulator of Vps4 activity; by interacting with Did2 and Vps4, Ist1 appears to regulate the recruitment and oligomerisation of Vps4. Together Ist1, Did2, and Vta1 form a network of interconnected regulatory proteins that modulate Vps4 activity, thereby regulating the flow of cargo through the MVB pathway [1].

Also often found adjacent to the DUF367 domain Pfam:PF04034 in uncharacterised proteins. The RNase L system plays a major role in the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities of interferons [1], and could possibly play a more general role in the regulation of RNA stability in mammalian cells. Inhibitory activity requires concentration-dependent association of RLI with RNase L [2].

Sina	PF03145.15	1	46	The seven in absentia (sina) gene was first identified in Drosophila. The Drosophila Sina protein is essential for the determination of the R7 pathway in photoreceptor cell development: the loss of functional Sina results in the transformation of the R7 precursor cell to a non- neuronal cell type. The Sina protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain Pfam:PF00097. Through this domain, Sina binds E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UbcD1) Sina also interacts with Tramtrack (TTK88) via PHYL. Tramtrack is a transcriptional repressor that blocks photoreceptor determination, while PHYL down-regulates the activity of TTK88. In turn, the activity of PHYL requires the activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase, a process essential for R7 determination. It is thought that thus Sina targets TTK88 for degradation, therefore promoting the R7 pathway. Murine and human homologues of Sina have also been identified. The human homologue Siah-1 [1] also binds E2 enzymes (UbcH5) and through a series of physical interactions, targets beta-catenin for ubiquitin degradation. Siah-1 expression is enhanced by p53, itself promoted by DNA damage. Thus this pathway links DNA damage to beta-catenin degradation [2,3]. Sina proteins, therefore, physically interact with a variety of proteins. The N-terminal RING finger domain that binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes is described in Pfam:PF00097, and does not form part of the alignment for this family. The remainder C-terminal part is involved in interactions with other proteins, and is included in this alignment. In addition to the Drosophila protein and mammalian homologues, whose similarity was noted previously, this family also includes putative homologues from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana.

CDC50	PF03381.14	1	340	Members of this family have been predicted to contain transmembrane helices. The family member LEM3 (Swiss:P42838) is a ligand-effect modulator, mutation of which increases glucocorticoid receptor activity in response to dexamethasone and also confers increased activity on other intracellular receptors including the progesterone, oestrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. LEM3 is thought to affect a downstream step in the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. Factors that modulate ligand responsiveness are likely to contribute to the context-specific actions of the glucocorticoid receptor in mammalian cells [1]. The products of genes YNR048w (Swiss:P53740), YNL323w (Swiss:P42838) and YCR094w (Swiss:P25656) (CDC50) show redundancy of function and are involved in regulation of transcription via CDC39 [2]. CDC39 (also known as NOT1) is normally a negative regulator of transcription either by affecting the general RNA polymerase II machinery or by altering chromatin structure [4]. One function of CDC39 is to block activation of the mating response pathway in the absence of pheromone, and mutation causes arrest in G1 by activation of the pathway [3]. It may be that the cold-sensitive arrest in G1 noticed in CDC50 mutants [2] may be due to inactivation of CDC39. The effects of LEM3 on glucocorticoid receptor activity may also be due to effects on transcription via CDC39.

Sterol-sensing	PF12349.7	1	25	Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound transcription factors that promote lipid synthesis in animal cells. They are embedded in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a helical hairpin orientation and are released from the ER by a two-step proteolytic process. Proteolysis begins when the SREBPs are cleaved at Site-1, which is located at a leucine residue in the middle of the hydrophobic loop in the lumen of the ER [1]. Upon proteolytic processing SREBP can activate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. SCAP stimulates cleavage of SREBPs via fusion of the their two C-termini [2]. This domain is the transmembrane region that traverses the membrane eight times and is the sterol-sensing domain of the cleavage protein [4]. WD40 domains are found towards the C-terminus.

CENP-T_C	PF15511.5	1	11	CENP-T is a family of vertebral kinetochore proteins that associates directly with CENP-W. The N-terminus of CENP-T proteins interacts directly with the Ndc80 complex in the outer kinetochore. Importantly, the CENP-T-W complex does not directly associate with CENP-A, but with histone H3 in the centromere region. CENP-T and -W form a hetero-tetramer with CENP-S and -X and bind to a ~100 bp region of nucleosome-free DNA forming a nucleosome-like structure. The DNA-CENP-T-W-S-X complex is likely to be associated with histone H3-containing nucleosomes rather than with CENP-nucleosomes. This domain is the C-terminal histone fold domain of CENP-T, which associates with chromatin [2-3].

CHCH	PF06747.12	1	50	we have identified a conserved motif in the LOC118487 protein that we have called the CHCH motif. Alignment of this protein with related members showed the presence of three subgroups of proteins, which are called the S (Small), N (N-terminal extended) and C (C-terminal extended) subgroups. All three sub-groups of proteins have in common that they contain a predicted conserved [coiled coil 1]-[helix 1]-[coiled coil 2]-[helix 2] domain (CHCH domain). Within each helix of the CHCH domain, there are two cysteines present in a C-X9-C motif. The N-group contains an additional double helix domain, and each helix contains the C-X9-C motif. This family contains a number of characterised proteins: Cox19 protein - a nuclear gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, codes for an 11-kDa protein (Cox19p) required for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Because cox19 mutants are able to synthesise the mitochondrial and nuclear gene products of cytochrome oxidase, Cox19p probably functions post-translationally during assembly of the enzyme. Cox19p is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it exists as a soluble intermembrane protein. This dual location is similar to what was previously reported for Cox17p, a low molecular weight copper protein thought to be required for maturation of the CuA centre of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase. Cox19p have four conserved potential metal ligands, these are three cysteines and one histidine. Mrp10 - belongs to the class of yeast mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are essential for translation [2]. Eukaryotic NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19 kDa (NDUFA8) subunit [3].

zf-ZPR1	PF03367.12	1	324	The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [1,2,3]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [1]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [1], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [2]. The ZPR1 domain consists of an elongation initiation factor 2-like zinc finger and a double-stranded beta helix with a helical hairpin insertion. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [4]. The alignment for this family shows a domain of which there are two copies in ZPR1 proteins. This family also includes several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota), which only contain one copy of the aligned region. This similarity between ZPR1 and archaeal proteins was not previously noted.	zf-ZPR1	Family	1366	155.1	35	65.99	Changed	ZPR1 zinc-finger domain	2QKD;2QKD	0.2202929156	138	17.1	11.0251450677

These are eukaryotic proteins that, through their binding of the 3' poly(A) tail on mRNA, have very important roles in the pathways of gene expression. They seem to provide a scaffold on which other proteins can bind and mediate processes such as export, translation and turnover of the transcripts. Moreover, they may act as antagonists to the binding of factors that allow mRNA degradation, regulating mRNA longevity. PABPs are also involved in nuclear transport. PABPs interact with poly(A) tails via RNA-recognition motifs (Pfam:PF00076) [1]. Note that the PABP C-terminal region is also found in members of the hyperplastic discs protein (HYD) family of ubiquitin ligases that contain HECT domains - these are also included in this family.

For examination of the components involved in this degradation process, mutants were isolated. They could be divided into four complementation groups. The mutations led to stabilisation of two different substrates for this process. The mutant classes were called 'der' for 'degradation in the ER'. DER1 was cloned by complementation of the der1-2 mutation. The DER1 gene codes for a novel, hydrophobic protein, that is localised to the ER. Deletion of DER1 abolished degradation of the substrate proteins. The function of the Der1 protein seems to be specifically required for the degradation process associated with the ER [1]. Interestingly this family seems distantly related to the Rhomboid family of membrane peptidases. Suggesting that this family may also mediate degradation of misfolded proteins (Bateman A pers. obs.).

The association of DcpS with 3' to 5' exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked and there is a coupled exonucleolytic decay-dependent decapping pathway. The C-terminal domain contains a histidine triad (HIT) sequence with three histidines separated by hydrophobic residues. The central histidine within the DcpS HIT motif is critical for decapping activity and defines the HIT motif as a new mRNA decapping domain, making DcpS the first member of the HIT family of proteins with a defined biological function.

All have been recombinantly expressed as active enzymes, albeit in various stages of activation [2]. In addition, a Clan CD peptidase, termed asparaginyl endopeptidase or 'legumain' has been identified. This has formerly been characterised as a 'haemoglobinase', but this term is probably incorrect [2]. Two cDNAs have been described for Schistosoma mansoni legumain; one encodes an active enzyme whereas the active site cysteine residue encoded by the second cDNA is substituted by an asparagine residue.

TspO_MBR	PF03073.14	1	527	Tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) is an integral membrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of the expression of specific photosynthesis genes in response to oxygen/light [1]. It is involved in the efflux of porphyrin intermediates from the cell. This reduces the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, which is thought to lead to the accumulation of a putative repressor molecule that inhibits the expression of specific photosynthesis genes. Several conserved aromatic residues are necessary for TspO function: they are thought to be involved in binding porphyrin intermediates [3]. In [2], the rat mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) was shown to not only retain its structure within a bacterial outer membrane, but also to be able to functionally substitute for TspO in TspO- mutants, and to act in a similar manner to TspO in its in situ location: the outer mitochondrial membrane. The biological significance of MBR remains unclear, however. It is thought to be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cholesterol transport in steroidogenic tissues.

There is some conservation of potentially functional residues, implying that in the bacterial members this family acts in some way as a phosphodiester glycosidase [1].

TraB	PF01963.16	1	203	pAD1 is a haemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid originally identified in Enterococcus faecalis DS16. It encodes a mating response to a peptide sex pheromone, cAD1, secreted by recipient bacteria. Once the plasmid pAD1 is acquired, production of the pheromone ceases--a trait related in part to a determinant designated traB. However a related protein is found in C. elegans Swiss:Q94217, suggesting that members of the TraB family have some more general function. This family also includes the bacterial GumN protein. The family has a conserved GXXH motif close to the N-terminus, a conserved glutamate and a conserved arginine that may be catalytic. The family also includes a second conserved GXXH motif near the C-terminus. This family also contains the Tiki proteins that regulate Wnt signalling [3].

The N-terminal domain contains the Pfam:PF00004 domain. In zebrafish, the liebeskummer (lik) mutation, causes development of hyperplastic embryonic hearts. lik encodes Reptin, a component of a DNA-stimulated ATPase complex. Beta-catenin and Pontin, a DNA-stimulated ATPase that is often part of complexes with Reptin, are in the same genetic pathways. The Reptin/Pontin ratio serves to regulate heart growth during development, at least in part via the beta-catenin pathway [1]. TBP-interacting protein 49 (TIP49) was originally identified as a TBP-binding protein, and two related proteins are encoded by individual genes, tip49a and b. Although the function of this gene family has not been elucidated, they are supposed to play a critical role in nuclear events because they interact with various kinds of nuclear factors and have DNA helicase activities.TIP49a has been suggested to act as an autoantigen in some patients with autoimmune diseases [2].

MH1	PF03165.15	1	19	The MH1 (MAD homology 1) domain is found at the amino terminus of MAD related proteins such as Smads. This domain is separated from the MH2 domain by a non-conserved linker region. The crystal structure of the MH1 domain shows that a highly conserved 11 residue beta hairpin is used to bind the DNA consensus sequence GNCN in the major groove, shown to be vital for the transcriptional activation of target genes. Not all examples of MH1 can bind to DNA however. Smad2 cannot bind DNA and has a large insertion within the hairpin that presumably abolishes DNA binding.

The family also contains several Xrn1 and Xrn2 proteins. The 5'-3' exoribonucleases Xrn1p and Xrn2p/Rat1p function in the degradation and processing of several classes of RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Frag1 is a membrane-spanning protein that is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues suggesting an important cellular function [1]. Dram is a family of proteins conserved from nematodes to humans with six hydrophobic transmembrane regions and an Endoplasmic Reticulum signal peptide. It is a lysosomal protein that induces macro-autophagy as an effector of p53-mediated death, where p53 is the tumour-suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in cancer. Expression of Dram is stress-induced [2]. This region is also part of a family of small plasma membrane proteins, referred to as Sfk1, that may act together with or upstream of Stt4p to generate normal levels of the essential phospholipid PI4P, thus allowing proper localisation of Stt4p to the actin cytoskeleton [3].

DOMON	PF03351.16	1	70	The DOMON (named after dopamine beta-monooxygenase N-terminal) domain is 110-125 residues long. It is predicted to form an all beta fold with up to 11 strands and is secreted to the extracellular compartment. The beta-strand folding produces a hydrophobic pocket which appears to bind soluble haem. This is consistent with the predominant architectures where the protein is associated with cytochromes or enzymatic domains whose activity involves redox or electron transfer reactions potentially as a direct participant in the electron transfer process. The DOMON domain superfamily, of which this is just one member, shows (1) multiple hydrophobic residues that contribute to the hydrophobic core of the strands of the beta-sandwich, and small residues found at the boundaries of strands and loops, (2) a strongly conserved charged residue (usually arginine/lysine) at the end of strand 9, which possibly stabilises the loop between 9 and 10, and (3) a polar residue (usually histidine, lysine or arginine), that interacts or coordinates with ligands [1]. The suggested superfamily includes both haem- and sugar-binding members: the haem-binding families being the ethyl-Benzoate dehydrogenase family EB_dh, Pfam:PF09459, the cellobiose dehydrogenase family CBDH and this family, and the sugar-binding families being the xylanases, CBM_4_9, Pfam:PF02018.

Tim44	PF04280.14	1	77	Tim44 is an essential component of the machinery that mediates the translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane [1]. Tim44 is thought to bind phospholipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane both by electrostatic interactions and by penetrating the polar head group region [1]. This family includes the C-terminal region of Tim44 that has been shown to form a stable proteolytic fragment in yeast. This region is also found in a set of smaller bacterial proteins. The molecular function of the bacterial members of this family is unknown but transport seems likely. The crystal structure of the C terminal of Tim44 has revealed a large hydrophobic pocket which might play an important role in interacting with the acyl chains of lipid molecules in the mitochondrial membrane [3].

DDHD	PF02862.16	1	169	The DDHD domain is 180 residues long and contains four conserved residues that may form a metal binding site. The domain is named after these four residues. This pattern of conservation of metal binding residues is often seen in phosphoesterase domains. This domain is found in retinal degeneration B proteins, as well as a family of probable phospholipases. It has been shown that this domain is found in a longer C terminal region that binds to PYK2 tyrosine kinase. These proteins have been called N-terminal domain-interacting receptor (Nir1, Nir2 and Nir3) [1]. This suggests that this region is involved in functionally important interactions in other members of this family.

eRF1_2	PF03464.14	1	21	The release factor eRF1 terminates protein biosynthesis by recognising stop codons at the A site of the ribosome and stimulating peptidyl-tRNA bond hydrolysis at the peptidyl transferase centre. The crystal structure of human eRF1 is known [1]. The overall shape and dimensions of eRF1 resemble a tRNA molecule with domains 1, 2, and 3 of eRF1 corresponding to the anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule, respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip of domain 2 suggests that the Gln residue coordinates a water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl transferase centre. A conserved groove on domain 1, 80 A from the GGQ motif, is proposed to form the codon recognition site [1]. This family also includes other proteins for which the precise molecular function is unknown. Many of them are from Archaebacteria. These proteins may also be involved in translation termination but this awaits experimental verification.	eRF1_2	Domain	1617	130.5	32	31.73	Changed	eRF1 domain 2	4CRN;4D5N;2VGN;2VGM;3AGK;2HST;3J5Y;3IZQ;3OBY;3VMF;4CRM;3E20;1DT9;3E1Y;3MCA;4D61;3J15;3J16;4AF1;3JAI;3JAG;3JAH	0.9149952619	122	8.5	6.5134099617

EHN	PF06441.11	1	600	This family represents the N-terminal region of the eukaryotic epoxide hydrolase protein. Epoxide hydrolases (EC:3.3.2.3) comprise a group of functionally related enzymes that catalyse the addition of water to oxirane compounds (epoxides), thereby usually generating vicinal trans-diols. EHs have been found in all types of living organisms, including mammals, invertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria. In animals, the major interest in EH is directed towards their detoxification capacity for epoxides since they are important safeguards against the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of oxirane derivatives that are often reactive electrophiles because of the high tension of the three-membered ring system and the strong polarization of the C--O bonds. This is of significant relevance because epoxides are frequent intermediary metabolites which arise during the biotransformation of foreign compounds [1]. This family is often found in conjunction with Pfam:PF00561.	EHN	Family	1619	108.5	35	26.21	Changed	Epoxide hydrolase N terminus	4QA9;4QLA;3G0I;4I19;3G02;1QO7	0.1436263318	96	12.5	11.5207373272

eRF1_1	PF03463.14	0	277	The release factor eRF1 terminates protein biosynthesis by recognising stop codons at the A site of the ribosome and stimulating peptidyl-tRNA bond hydrolysis at the peptidyl transferase centre. The crystal structure of human eRF1 is known [1]. The overall shape and dimensions of eRF1 resemble a tRNA molecule with domains 1, 2, and 3 of eRF1 corresponding to the anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule, respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip of domain 2 suggests that the Gln residue coordinates a water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl transferase centre. A conserved groove on domain 1, 80 A from the GGQ motif, is proposed to form the codon recognition site [1]. This family also includes other proteins for which the precise molecular function is unknown. Many of them are from Archaebacteria. These proteins may also be involved in translation termination but this awaits experimental verification.	eRF1_1	Domain	1647	124.2	34	30.37	Changed	eRF1 domain 1	2LGT;2MQ9;3WXM;2MQ6;4CRN;4D5N;2VGN;2VGM;3J5Y;3IZQ;3OBY;3E20;1DT9;3E1Y;3MCA;3OBW;4D61;3J15;3J16;4AF1;2QI2;3JAI;3JAG;2LLX;3JAH

Tubulin-binding	PF00418.18	1	112	This family includes the vertebrate proteins MAP2, MAP4 and Tau, as well as other animal homologs. MAP4 is present in many tissues but is usually absent from neurons; MAP2 and Tau are mainly neuronal. Members of this family have the ability to bind to and stabilise microtubules. As a result, they are involved in neuronal migration, supporting dendrite elongation, and regulating microtubules during mitotic metaphase. Note that Tau (Swiss:P10636) is involved in neurofibrillary tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease and some other dementias. This family features a C-terminal microtubule binding repeat that contains a conserved KXGS motif [1].

EXS	PF03124.13	1	339	We have named this region the EXS family after (ERD1, XPR1, and SYG1). This family includes C-terminus portions from the SYG1 G-protein associated signal transduction protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and sequences that are thought to be murine leukaemia virus (MLV) receptors (XPR1). N-terminus portions from these proteins are aligned in the SPX Pfam:PF03105 family. The previously noted similarity between SYG1 and MLV receptors over their whole sequences [1] is thus borne out in Pfam:PF03105 and this family. While the N-termini aligned in Pfam:PF03105 are thought to be involved in signal transduction, the role of the C-terminus sequences aligned in this family is not known. This region of similarity contains several predicted transmembrane helices. This family also includes the ERD1 (ERD: ER retention defective) yeast proteins Swiss:P16151. ERD1 proteins are involved in the localisation of endogenous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. erd1 null mutants secrete such proteins even though they possess the C-terminal HDEL ER lumen localisation label sequence. In addition, null mutants also exhibit defects in the Golgi-dependent processing of several glycoproteins, which led to the suggestion that the sorting of luminal ER proteins actually occurs in the Golgi, with subsequent return of these proteins to the ER via `salvage' vesicles [2].

GCS2	PF04107.12	0	12	Also known as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and gamma-ECS (EC:6.3.2.2). This enzyme catalyses the first and rate limiting step in de novo glutathione biosynthesis. Members of this family are found in archaea, bacteria and plants. May and Leaver [1] discuss the possible evolutionary origins of glutamate-cysteine ligase enzymes in different organisms and suggest that it evolved independently in different eukaryotes, from an ancestral bacterial enzyme. They also state that Arabidopsis thaliana gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase is structurally unrelated to mammalian, yeast and Escherichia coli homologues. In plants, there are separate cytosolic and chloroplast forms of the enzyme.	GCS2	Family	1669	273.7	21	65.4	Changed	Glutamate-cysteine ligase family 2(GCS2)	1TT4;2GWD;2GWC;1R8G

ELMO_CED12	PF04727.12	1	230	This family represents a conserved domain which is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins including CED-12, ELMO I and ELMO II. ELMO1 is a component of signalling pathways that regulate phagocytosis and cell migration and is the mammalian orthologue of the C. elegans gene, ced-12. CED-12 is required for the engulfment of dying cells and cell migration. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 interacts with Dock180 as part of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac pathway responsible for phagocytosis and cell migration. ELMO1 is ubiquitously expressed, although its expression is highest in the spleen, an organ rich in immune cells [1].

FGF	PF00167.17	1	52	Fibroblast growth factors are a family of proteins involved in growth and differentiation in a wide range of contexts. They are found in a wide range of organisms, from nematodes to humans [2]. Most share an internal core region of high similarity, conserved residues in which are involved in binding with their receptors. On binding, they cause dimerisation of their tyrosine kinase receptors leading to intracellular signalling. There are currently four known tyrosine kinase receptors for fibroblast growth factors. These receptors can each bind several different members of this family. Members of this family have a beta trefoil structure. Most have N-terminal signal peptides and are secreted. A few lack signal sequences but are secreted anyway; still others also lack the signal peptide but are found on the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. A third group remain intracellular [2]. They have central roles in development, regulating cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. On the other hand, they are important in tissue repair following injury in adult organisms [2].

eRF1_3	PF03465.14	1	34	The release factor eRF1 terminates protein biosynthesis by recognising stop codons at the A site of the ribosome and stimulating peptidyl-tRNA bond hydrolysis at the peptidyl transferase centre. The crystal structure of human eRF1 is known [1]. The overall shape and dimensions of eRF1 resemble a tRNA molecule with domains 1, 2, and 3 of eRF1 corresponding to the anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule, respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip of domain 2 suggests that the Gln residue coordinates a water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl transferase centre. A conserved groove on domain 1, 80 A from the GGQ motif, is proposed to form the codon recognition site [1]. This family also includes other proteins for which the precise molecular function is unknown. Many of them are from Archaebacteria. These proteins may also be involved in translation termination but this awaits experimental verification.	eRF1_3	Domain	1708	117.4	35	29.08	Changed	eRF1 domain 3	3WXM;4CRN;4D5N;2VGN;2VGM;3AGK;3J5Y;3IZQ;2KTV;3IR9;3OBY;3VMF;4CRM;3E20;1DT9;3E1Y;2KTU;3MCA;3OBW;4D61;3J15;3J16;4AF1;1X52;2QI2;3JAI;3JAG;3JAH	0.7787979674	92	25.4	21.6354344123

TENA_THI-4	PF03070.15	0	19	Members of this family are found in all the three major phyla of life: archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. In Bacillus subtilis, TENA is one of a number of proteins that enhance the expression of extracellular enzymes, such as alkaline protease, neutral protease and levansucrase [1]. The THI-4 protein, which is involved in thiamine biosynthesis, is also a member of this family. The C-terminal part of these proteins consistently show significant sequence similarity to TENA proteins. This similarity was first noted with the Neurospora crassa THI-4 [2]. This family includes bacterial coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein C or PQQC proteins. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes,including methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of a number of bacteria [3]. PQQC has been found to be required in the synthesis of PQQ but its function is unclear. The exact molecular function of members of this family is uncertain.

Rad60-SLD	PF11976.7	1	33	The small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 is a Ub/Ubl family member, and although SUMO-1 shares structural similarity to Ub, SUMO's cellular functions remain distinct insomuch as SUMO modification alters protein function through changes in activity, cellular localisation, or by protecting substrates from ubiquitination [1]. Rad60 family members contain functionally enigmatic, integral SUMO-like domains (SLDs). Despite their divergence from SUMO, each Rad60 SLD interacts with a subset of SUMO pathway enzymes: SLD2 specifically binds the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9)), whereas SLD1 binds the SUMO E1 (Fub2, also called Uba2) activating and E3 (Pli1, also called Siz1 and Siz2) specificity enzymes. Structural analysis of PDB:2uyz reveals a mechanistic basis for the near-synonymous roles of Rad60 and SUMO in survival of genotoxic stress and suggest unprecedented DNA-damage-response functions for SLDs in regulating SUMOylation [2]. The Rad60 branch of this family is also known as RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45), and biologically it should be two distinct families SUMO and RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45).

EndIII_4Fe-2S	PF10576.8	1	499	Escherichia coli endonuclease III (EC 4.2.99.18) [1] is a DNA repair enzyme that acts both as a DNA N-glycosylase, removing oxidised pyrimidines from DNA, and as an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, introducing a single-strand nick at the site from which the damaged base was removed. Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single 4Fe-4S cluster. The 4Fe-4S cluster does not seem to be important for catalytic activity, but is probably involved in the proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand [2]. The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which are all located in a 17 amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III. A similar region is also present in the central section of mutY and in the C-terminus of ORF-10 and of the Micro-coccus UV endonuclease [4].

Got1 is thought to facilitate Sed5-dependent fusion events [1]. This is a family of sequences derived from eukaryotic proteins. They are similar to a region of a SNARE-like protein required for traffic through the Golgi complex, SFT2 protein (Swiss:P38166) [2]. This is a conserved protein with four putative transmembrane helices, thought to be involved in vesicular transport in later Golgi compartments [1].

OATP	PF03137.19	1	270	This family consists of several eukaryotic Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs). Several have been identified mostly in human and rat. Different OATPs vary in tissue distribution and substrate specificity. Since the numbering of different OATPs in particular species was based originally on the order of discovery, similarly numbered OATPs in humans and rats did not necessarily correspond in function, tissue distribution and substrate specificity (in spite of the name, some OATPs also transport organic cations and neutral molecules). Thus, Tamai et al. [1] initiated the current scheme of using digits for rat OATPs and letters for human ones. Prostaglandin transporter (PGT) proteins (e.g. Swiss:Q92959) are also considered to be OATP family members. In addition, the methotrexate transporter OATK (Swiss:P70502) is closely related to OATPs. This family also includes several predicted proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. This similarity was not previously noted. Note: Members of this family are described (in the Swiss-Prot database) as belonging to the SLC21 family of transporters.

MACPF	PF01823.18	1	45	The membrane-attack complex (MAC) of the complement system forms transmembrane channels. These channels disrupt the phospholipid bilayer of target cells, leading to cell lysis and death. A number of proteins participate in the assembly of the MAC. Freshly activated C5b binds to C6 to form a C5b-6 complex, then to C7 forming the C5b-7 complex. The C5b-7 complex binds to C8, which is composed of three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), thus forming the C5b-8 complex. C5b-8 subsequently binds to C9 and acts as a catalyst in the polymerisation of C9. Active MAC has a subunit composition of C5b-C6-C7-C8-C9{n}. Perforin is a protein found in cytolytic T-cell and killer cells. In the presence of calcium, perforin polymerises into transmembrane tubules and is capable of lysing, non-specifically, a variety of target cells. There are a number of regions of similarity in the sequences of complement components C6, C7, C8-alpha, C8-beta, C9 and perforin. The X-ray crystal structure of a MACPF domain reveals that it shares a common fold with bacterial cholesterol dependent cytolysins (Pfam:PF01289) such as perfringolysin O. Three key pieces of evidence suggests that MACPF domains and CDCs are homologous: Functional similarity (pore formation), conservation of three glycine residues at a hinge in both families and conservation of a complex core fold [1].

We propose that the human protein Q96FZ2:UniProtKB, the eukaryotic member of the SRAP family, which has been recently shown to bind specifically to DNA with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine, is a sensor for these oxidized bases generated by the TET (tetrahedral aminopeptidase of the M42 family) enzymes from methylcytosine. Hence, its autoproteolytic activity might help it act as a switch that recruits DNA repair enzymes to remove these oxidized methylcytosine species as part of the DNA demethylation pathway downstream of the TET enzymes.

The B subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha plays an essential role at the initial stage of DNA replication in S. cerevisiae and is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. DNA polymerase epsilon is essential for cell viability and chromosomal DNA replication in budding yeast. In addition, DNA polymerase epsilon may be involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoint control. The enzyme consists of at least four subunits in mammalian cells as well as in yeast. The largest subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon is responsible for polymerase epsilon is responsible for polymerase activity. In mouse, the DNA polymerase epsilon subunit B is the second largest subunit of the DNA polymerase. A part of the N-terminal was found to be responsible for the interaction with SAP18. Experimental evidence suggests that this subunit may recruit histone deacetylase to the replication fork to modify the chromatin structure [1].

Exo70	PF03081.14	1	289	The Exo70 protein forms one subunit of the exocyst complex. First discovered in S. cerevisiae [1], Exo70 and other exocyst proteins have been observed in several other eukaryotes, including humans. In S. cerevisiae, the exocyst complex is involved in the late stages of exocytosis, and is localised at the tip of the bud, the major site of exocytosis in yeast [1]. Exo70 interacts with the Rho3 GTPase [4]. This interaction mediates one of the three known functions of Rho3 in cell polarity: vesicle docking and fusion with the plasma membrane (the other two functions are regulation of actin polarity and transport of exocytic vesicles from the mother cell to the bud) [3]. In humans, the functions of Exo70 and the exocyst complex are less well characterised: Exo70 is expressed in several tissues and is thought to also be involved in exocytosis [2].

PMT	PF02366.17	1	19	This is a family of Dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase proteins EC:2.4.1.109. These proteins are responsible for O-linked glycosylation of proteins, they catalyse the reaction:- Dolichyl phosphate D-mannose + protein <=> dolichyl phosphate + O-D-mannosyl-protein. Also in this family is Swiss:Q94891 Drosophila rotated abdomen protein which is a putative mannosyltransferase [2]. This family appears to be distantly related to Pfam:PF02516 (A Bateman pers. obs.). This family also contains sequences from ArnTs (4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose lipid A transferase). They catalyse the addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) to the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide [4]. This is a critical modification enabling bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) to resist killing by antimicrobial peptides such as polymyxins [5]. Members such as Swiss:O52327 are predicted to have 12 trans-membrane regions. The N-terminal portion of these proteins is hypothesised to have a conserved glycosylation activity which is shared between distantly related oligosaccharyltransferases ArnT and PglB families [4].

However possible family members have also been identified in translated rat (Genbank:AW144450) and human (Genbank:AI478629) ESTs. A mouse family member has been named SIMPL (signalling molecule that associates with mouse pelle-like kinase). SIMPL appears to facilitate and/or regulate complex formation between IRAK/mPLK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and IKK (inhibitor of kappa-B kinase) containing complexes, and thus regulate NF-kappa-B activity [1]. Separate experiments demonstrate that a mouse family member (named LaXp180) binds the Listeria monocytogenes surface protein ActA, which is a virulence factor that induces actin polymerisation. It may also bind stathmin, a protein involved in signal transduction and in the regulation of microtubule dynamics [2].

Syntaxin	PF00804.24	1	75	Syntaxins are the prototype family of SNARE proteins. They usually consist of three main regions - a C-terminal transmembrane region, a central SNARE domain which is characteristic of and conserved in all syntaxins (Pfam:PF05739), and an N-terminal domain that is featured in this entry. This domain varies between syntaxin isoforms; in syntaxin 1A (Swiss:O35526) it is found as three alpha-helices with a left-handed twist. It may fold back on the SNARE domain to allow the molecule to adopt a 'closed' configuration that prevents formation of the core fusion complex - it thus has an auto-inhibitory role. The function of syntaxins is determined by their localisation. They are involved in neuronal exocytosis, ER-Golgi transport and Golgi-endosome transport, for example. They also interact with other proteins as well as those involved in SNARE complexes. These include vesicle coat proteins, Rab GTPases, and tethering factors [6].

BIR	PF00653.20	1	85	BIR stands for 'Baculovirus Inhibitor of apoptosis protein Repeat'. It is found repeated in inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and in fact it is also known as IAP repeat. These domains characteristically have a number of invariant residues, including 3 conserved cysteines and one conserved histidine that coordinate a zinc ion. They are usually made up of 4-5 alpha helices and a three-stranded beta-sheet. BIR is also found in other proteins known as BIR-domain-containing proteins (BIRPs), such as Survivin (Swiss:O15392) [2].

AFG1_ATPase	PF03969.15	0	7	This P-loop motif-containing family of proteins includes AFG1, LACE1 and ZapE. ATPase family gene 1 (AFG1) is a 377 amino acid yeast protein with an ATPase motif typical of the family [1]. LACE1, the mammalian homologue of AFG1, is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein that is essential for maintenance of fused mitochondrial reticulum and lamellar cristae morphology. It has also been demonstrated that LACE1 mediates degradation of nuclear-encoded complex IV subunits COX4 (cytochrome c oxidase 4), COX5A and COX6A, and is required for normal activity of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain [2]. ZapE is a cell division protein found in Gram-negative bacteria. The bacterial cell division process relies on the assembly, positioning, and constriction of FtsZ ring (the so-called Z-ring), a ring-like network that marks the future site of the septum of bacterial cell division. ZapE is a Z-ring associated protein required for cell division under low-oxygen conditions. It is an ATPase that appears at the constricting Z-ring late in cell division.

The domain adopts the winged helix-turn- helix fold and bind RNA with a potential specificity for dsRNA [1].In eukaryotes this domain is often combined in the same polypeptide with protein-protein- or lipid- interaction domains that might play a role in anchoring these proteins to specific cytoskeletal structures. Thus, proteins with this domain might have a key role in the recognition and localization of dsRNA, including miRNAs, rasiRNAs and piRNAs hybridized to their targets. In other cases, this domain is fused to ubiquitin-binding, E3 ligase and ubiquitin-like domains indicating a previously under-appreciated role for ubiquitination in regulating the assembly and stability of nuage-like RNP complexes. Both bacteria and eukaryotes encode a conserved family of proteins that combines this predicted RNA-binding domain with a previously uncharacterized RNase domain belonging to the superfamily that includes the 5'->3' nucleases, PIN and NYN domains [1].

Tyr_Deacylase	PF02580.15	1	1003	This family comprises of several D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase proteins. Cell growth inhibition by several d-amino acids can be explained by an in vivo production of d-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules. Escherichia coli and yeast cells express an enzyme, d-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase, capable of recycling such d-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules into free tRNA and d-amino acid. Accordingly, upon inactivation of the genes of the above deacylases, the toxicity of d-amino acids increases. Orthologues of the deacylase are found in many cells [1].

Bestrophin	PF01062.20	1	201	Bestrophin is a 68-kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular dystrophy, a disease characterised by a depressed light peak in the electrooculogram [1]. VMD2 encodes a 585-amino acid protein with an approximate mass of 68 kDa which has been designated bestrophin. Bestrophin shares homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans RFP gene family, named for the presence of a conserved arginine (R), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), amino acid sequence motif. Bestrophin is a plasma membrane protein, localised to the basolateral surface of RPE cells consistent with a role for bestrophin in the generation or regulation of the EOG light peak. Bestrophin and other RFP family members represent a new class of chloride channels, indicating a direct role for bestrophin in generating the light peak [1]. The VMD2 gene underlying Best disease was shown to represent the first human member of the RFP-TM protein family. More than 97% of the disease-causing mutations are located in the N-terminal RFP-TM domain implying important functional properties [2]. The bestrophins are four-pass transmembrane chloride-channel proteins [3], and the RFP-TM or bestrophin domain extends from the N-terminus through approximately 350 amino acids and contains all of the TM domains as well as nearly all reported disease causing mutations [4]. Interestingly, the RFP motif is not conserved evolutionarily back beyond Metazoa, neither is it in plant members.

This zinc-finger domain together with the RDM domain, Pfam:PF11002, forms a large zinc-finger structure of the RING/U-Box superfamily. RING-containing proteins are known to exert an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity with the zinc-finger structure being mandatory for binding to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [3].	zf-C3HC4_4	Domain	2631	41.9	43	8.77	Changed	zinc finger of C3HC4-type, RING	2YSL;2ECJ;2ECW;2ECV;4TKP;2EGP;2YSJ	0.9267880194	40	1.9	4.5346062053

CLTH	PF10607.8	1	122	RanBPM is a scaffolding protein and is important in regulating cellular function in both the immune system and the nervous system. This domain is at the C-terminus of the proteins and is the binding domain for the CRA motif (for CT11-RanBPM), which is comprised of approximately 100 amino acids at the C terminal of RanBPM. It was found to be important for the interaction of RanBPM with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), but its functional significance has yet to be determined [5]. This region contains CTLH and CRA domains annotated by SMART; however, these may be a single domain, and it is refereed to as a C-terminal to LisH motif [6].

PLDc	PF00614.21	1	30	Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms are activated by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). PLD produces phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine, which may be essential for the formation of certain types of transport vesicles or may be constitutive vesicular transport to signal transduction pathways. PC-hydrolysing PLD is a homologue of cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial PLDs, and viral proteins. Each of these appears to possess a domain duplication which is apparent by the presence of two motifs containing well-conserved histidine, lysine, and/or asparagine residues which may contribute to the active site. aspartic acid. An E. coli endonuclease (nuc) and similar proteins appear to be PLD homologues but possess only one of these motifs. The profile contained here represents only the putative active site regions, since an accurate multiple alignment of the repeat units has not been achieved.

Cullin_Nedd8	PF10557.8	1	407	This is the neddylation site of cullin proteins which are a family of structurally related proteins containing an evolutionarily conserved cullin domain. With the exception of APC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process in which the 26S proteasome recognises and subsequently degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Cullins are molecular scaffolds responsible for assembling the ROC1/Rbx1 RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which several play a direct role in tumorigenesis. Nedd8/Rub1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein, which was originally found to be conjugated to Cdc53, a cullin component of the SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Nedd8 modification has now emerged as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle control and for embryogenesis in metazoans. The only identified Nedd8 substrates are cullins. Neddylation results in covalent conjugation of a Nedd8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine residue [1].

Two copies of the repeat are found in mahogany protein. A related C. elegans protein (Swiss:Q19981) contains four copies of the repeat. The Met receptor contains a single copy of the repeat. The Pfam alignment shows 6 conserved cysteine residues that may form three conserved disulphide bridges, whereas [1] shows 8 conserved cysteines. The pattern of conservation suggests that cysteines 5 and 7 (that are not absolutely conserved) form a disulphide bridge (Personal observation. A Bateman).

Med26	PF08711.10	1	516	Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species {1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function [3]. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex [4]. This family includesthe C terminal region of a number of eukaryotic hypothetical proteins which are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein IWS1. IWS1 is known to be an Pol II transcription elongation factor and interacts with Spt6 and Spt5 [5,6].

Mpv17_PMP22	PF04117.11	1	573	The 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP22) is a major component of peroxisomal membranes. PMP22 seems to be involved in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesised on free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome membrane by specific targeting information [1]. Mpv17 is a closely related peroxisomal protein. In mouse, the Mpv17 protein is involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis [2]. More recently a homolog of Mpv17 in S. cerevisiae has been been found to be an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it has been proposed to have a role in ethanol metabolism and tolerance during heat-shock [3]. Defects in MPV17 is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) and Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH) [4][5]. MDDS is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Primary mtDNA depletion is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and may affect single organs, typically muscle or liver, or multiple tissues. Individuals with the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome have early progressive liver failure and neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and increased lactate in body fluids. NNH is an autosomal recessive disease that is prevalent among Navajo children in the South Western states of America. The major clinical features are hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, corneal anesthesia and scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with intercurrent infections. Infantile, childhood, and classic forms of NNH have been described. Mitochondrial DNA depletion was detected in the livers of patients, suggesting a primary defect in mtDNA maintenance [5].

GPS	PF01825.20	1	395	The GPS motif is found in GPCRs, and is the site for auto-proteolysis, so is thus named, GPS [1,2,3,4]. The GPS motif is a conserved sequence of ~40 amino acids containing canonical cysteine and tryptophan residues, and is the most highly conserved part of the domain. In most, if not all, cell-adhesion GPCRs these undergo autoproteolysis in the GPS between a conserved aliphatic residue (usually a leucine) and a threonine, serine, or cysteine residue [5]. In higher eukaryotes this motif is found embedded in the C-terminal beta-stranded part of a GAIN domain - GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN). The GAIN-GPS domain adopts a fold in which the GPS motif, at the C-terminus, forms five beta-strands that are tightly integrated into the overall GAIN domain. The GPS motif, evolutionarily conserved from tetrahymena to mammals, is the only extracellular domain shared by all human cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, and is the locus of multiple human disease mutations. The GAIN-GPS domain is both necessary and sufficient functionally for autoproteolysis, suggesting an autoproteolytic mechanism whereby the overall GAIN domain fine-tunes the chemical environment in the GPS to catalyse peptide bond hydrolysis [6]. In the cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, the GPS motif is always located at the end of their long N-terminal extracellular regions, immediately before the first transmembrane helix of the respective protein.

FtsH_ext	PF06480.14	1	157	This domain is found in the FtsH family of proteins. FtsH is the only membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease universally conserved in prokaryotes ([1]). It only efficiently degrades proteins that have a low thermodynamic stability - e.g. it lacks robust unfoldase activity. This feature may be key and implies that this could be a criterion for degrading a protein. In Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental stress ([2]), and shows increased expression under heat or osmotic stress. These two lines of evidence suggest that it is a fundamental prokaryotic self-protection mechanism that checks if proteins are correctly folded (personal obs: Yeats C). The precise function of this N-terminal region is unclear.	FtsH_ext	Family	3041	100.7	15	14.88	Changed	FtsH Extracellular	2LNA;4V0B;2MUY	0.5299026251	87	13.7	13.6047666336

PAZ	PF02170.21	1	254	This domain is named PAZ after the proteins Piwi Argonaut and Zwille. This domain is found in two families of proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. These are the Piwi family and the Dicer family, that includes the Carpel factory protein. The function of the domains is unknown but has been suggested to mediate complex formation between proteins of the Piwi and Dicer families by hetero-dimerisation. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved [2-4]. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains. PAZ can bind the characteristic two-base 3' overhangs of siRNAs, indicating that although PAZ may not be a primary nucleic acid binding site in Dicer or RISC, it may contribute to the specific and productive incorporation of siRNAs and miRNAs into the RNAi pathway.

cEGF	PF12662.6	1	555	cEGF, or complement Clr-like EGF, domains have six conserved cysteine residues disulfide-bonded into the characteristic pattern 'ababcc'. They are found in blood coagulation proteins such as fibrillin, Clr and Cls, thrombomodulin, and the LDL receptor. The core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small beta-hairpins packed against each other. Two major structural variants have been identified based on the structural context of the C-terminal cysteine residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In cEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides on the C-terminal beta-sheet, resulting in long loop-lengths between the cysteine residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[10+]XC. These longer loop-lengths may have arisen by selective cysteine loss from a four-disulfide EGF template such as laminin or integrin. Tandem cEGF domains have five linking residues between terminal cysteines of adjacent domains. cEGF domains may or may not bind calcium in the linker region. cEGF domains with the consensus motif CXN4X[F,Y]XCXC are hydroxylated exclusively on the asparagine residue.	cEGF	Domain	3409	23.8	48	2.21	Changed	Complement Clr-like EGF-like	1FGD;1HLT	0.1347298662	22	1.8	7.5630252101

SelR	PF01641.17	1	971	Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterised with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidised methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR , evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain Pfam:PF01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines. The domain binds both selenium and zinc [2]. The final cysteine is found to be replaced by the rare amino acid selenocysteine in some members of the family [1]. This family has methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase activity [2].

TTL	PF03133.14	1	20	Tubulins and microtubules are subjected to several post-translational modifications of which the reversible detyrosination/tyrosination of the carboxy-terminal end of most alpha-tubulins has been extensively analysed. This modification cycle involves a specific carboxypeptidase and the activity of the tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) [2]. The true physiological function of TTL has so far not been established. Tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) catalyses the ATP-dependent post-translational addition of a tyrosine to the carboxy terminal end of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. In normally cycling cells, the tyrosinated form of tubulin predominates. However, in breast cancer cells, the detyrosinated form frequently predominates, with a correlation to tumour aggressiveness [3]. On the other hand, 3-nitrotyrosine has been shown to be incorporated, by TTL, into the carboxy terminal end of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. This reaction is not reversible by the carboxypeptidase enzyme. Cells cultured in 3-nitrotyrosine rich medium showed evidence of altered microtubule structure and function, including altered cell morphology, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and apoptosis [4]. Bacterial homologs of TTL are predicted to form peptide tags. Some of these are fused to a 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase domain [6].

Nramp	PF01566.17	1	92	The natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) family consists of Nramp1, Nramp2, and yeast proteins Smf1 and Smf2. The NRAMP family is a novel family of functional related proteins defined by a conserved hydrophobic core of ten transmembrane domains [5]. This family of membrane proteins are divalent cation transporters. Nramp1 is an integral membrane protein expressed exclusively in cells of the immune system and is recruited to the membrane of a phagosome upon phagocytosis [1]. By controlling divalent cation concentrations Nramp1 may regulate the interphagosomal replication of bacteria [1]. Mutations in Nramp1 may genetically predispose an individual to susceptibility to diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis conversely this might however provide protection form rheumatoid arthritis [1]. Nramp2 is a multiple divalent cation transporter for Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ amongst others it is expressed at high levels in the intestine; and is major transferrin-independent iron uptake system in mammals [1]. The yeast proteins Smf1 and Smf2 may also transport divalent cations [3].

O-FucT	PF10250.8	1	197	This is a family of conserved proteins representing the enzyme responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats. Six highly conserved cysteines are present in O-FucT-1 as well as a DXD-like motif (ERD), conserved in mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans. Both features are characteristic of several glycosyltransferase families. The enzyme is a membrane-bound protein released by proteolysis and, as for most glycosyltransferases, is strongly activated by manganese [1].

Pirin	PF02678.15	1	38	This family consists of Pirin proteins from both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The function of Pirin is unknown but the gene coding for this protein is known to be expressed in all tissues in the human body although it is expressed most strongly in the liver and heart. Pirin is known to be a nuclear protein, exclusively localised within the nucleoplasma and predominantly concentrated within dot-like subnuclear structures [1]. A tomato homologue of human Pirin has been found to be induced during programmed cell death [2]. Human Pirin interacts with Bcl-3 and NFI [3] and hence is probably involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and replication. It appears to be an Fe(II)-containing member of the Cupin superfamily.

Bax1-I	PF01027.19	1	321	Programmed cell-death involves a set of Bcl-2 family proteins, some of which inhibit apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) and some of which promote it (Bax and Bak). Human Bax inhibitor, BI-1, is an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein containing multiple membrane-spanning segments predominantly localised to intracellular membranes. It has 6-7 membrane-spanning domains. The C termini of the mammalian BI-1 proteins are comprised of basic amino acids resembling some nuclear targeting sequences, but otherwise the predicted proteins lack motifs that suggest a function. As plant BI-1 appears to localise predominantly to the ER, we hypothesized that plant BI-1 could also regulate cell death triggered by ER stress [2]. BI-1 appears to exert its effect through an interaction with calmodulin [3]. The budding yeast member of this family has been found unexpectedly to encode a BH3 domain-containing protein (Ybh3p) that regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in a phylogenetically conserved manner [4]. Examination of the crystal structure of a bacterial member of this family shows that these proteins mediate a calcium leak across the membrane that is pH-dependent. Calcium homoeostasis balances passive calcium leak with active calcium uptake. The structure exists in a pore-closed and pore-open conformation, at pHs of 8 and 6 respectively, and the pore can be opened by intracrystalline transition; together these findings suggest that pH controls the conformational transition [5].

The PC-Esterase family has features that are both similar and different from the canonical GDSL/SGNH superfamily [1]. The members of this family are predicted to have Acyl esterase activity and predicted to modify cell-surface biopolymers such as glycans and glycoproteins [1][3]. The Cas1p protein has a Cas1_AcylT domain, in addition, with the opposing acyltransferase activity [1]. The C7orf58 family has a ATP-Grasp domain fused to the PC-Esterase and is the first identified secreted tubulin-tyrosine ligase like enzyme in eukaryotes [1]. The plant family with PMR5, ESK1, TBL3 etc have a N-terminal C rich potential sugar binding domain followed by PC-Esterase domain [1].

Piwi	PF02171.16	1	16	This domain is found in the protein Piwi and its relatives. The function of this domain is the dsRNA guided hydrolysis of ssRNA. Determination of the crystal structure of Argonaute reveals that PIWI is an RNase H domain, and identifies Argonaute as Slicer, the enzyme that cleaves mRNA in the RNAi RISC complex [2]. In addition, Mg+2 dependence and production of 3'-OH and 5' phosphate products are shared characteristics of RNaseH and RISC. The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to the RNase H family of enzymes. RNase H fold proteins all have a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices. By analogy to RNase H enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA guided by the DNA strand in an RNA/DNA hybrid, the PIWI domain can be inferred to cleave single-stranded RNA, for example mRNA, guided by double stranded siRNA.

PUA	PF01472.19	1	93	The PUA domain named after Pseudouridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase, was detected in archaeal and eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases, archaeal archaeosine synthases, a family of predicted ATPases that may be involved in RNA modification, a family of predicted archaeal and bacterial rRNA methylases. Additionally, the PUA domain was detected in a family of eukaryotic proteins that also contain a domain homologous to the translation initiation factor eIF1/SUI1; these proteins may comprise a novel type of translation factors. Unexpectedly, the PUA domain was detected also in bacterial and yeast glutamate kinases; this is compatible with the demonstrated role of these enzymes in the regulation of the expression of other genes [1]. It is predicted that the PUA domain is an RNA binding domain.

NYN	PF01936.17	1	147	These domains are found in the eukaryotic proteins typified by the Nedd4-binding protein 1 and the bacterial YacP-like proteins (Nedd4-BP1, YacP nucleases; NYN domains). The NYN domain shares a common protein fold with two other previously characterized groups of nucleases, namely the PIN (PilT N-terminal) and FLAP/5' --> 3' exonuclease superfamilies. These proteins share a common set of 4 acidic conserved residues that are predicted to constitute their active site. Based on the conservation of the acidic residues and structural elements Aravind and colleagues suggest that PIN and NYN domains are likely to bind only a single metal ion, unlike the FLAP/5' --> 3' exonuclease superfamily, which binds two metal ions. Based on conserved gene neighborhoods Aravind and colleagues infer that the bacterial members are likely to be components of the processome/degradsome that process tRNAs or ribosomal RNAs.

TGT	PF01702.17	1	885	This is a family of queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferases EC:2.4.2.29, also known as tRNA-guanine transglycosylase and guanine insertion enzyme. Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase modifies tRNAs for asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine and tyrosine with queuine. It catalyses the exchange of guanine-34 at the wobble position with 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine, and the addition of a cyclopentenediol moiety to 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine-34 tRNA; giving a hypermodified base queuine in the wobble position [1,2]. The aligned region contains a zinc binding motif C-x-C-x2-C-x29-H, and important tRNA and 7-aminomethyl-7deazaguanine binding residues [1].

1-cysPrx_C	PF10417.8	1	46	This is the C-terminal domain of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-cysPrx), a member of the peroxiredoxin superfamily which protect cells against membrane oxidation through glutathione (GSH)-dependent reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxides to corresponding alcohols [1]. The C-terminal domain is crucial for providing the extra cysteine necessary for dimerisation of the whole molecule. Loss of the enzyme's peroxidase activity is associated with oxidation of the catalytic cysteine, upstream of this domain; and glutathionylation, presumably through its disruption of protein structure, facilitates access for GSH, resulting in spontaneous reduction of the mixed disulfide to the sulfhydryl and consequent activation of the enzyme [2]. The domain is associated with family AhpC-TSA, Pfam:PF00578, which carries the catalytic cysteine.	1-cysPrx_C	Domain	3774	36.7	33	16.91	Changed	C-terminal domain of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin	2NVL;3A2V;3TKR;3ZTL;3TB2;3W8J;1XCC;3HY2;4KB3;2E2M;3TJG;2H01;2V32;2Z9S;3VWV;1E2Y;4MAB;3TKS;3TKS;3TKS;3TKQ;1PRX;4O5R;3A2W;1WE0;3TJK;3TUE;1YF0;3W6G;4KCE;3VWU;3QPM;1ZOF;4LLR;3ZVJ;3ZVJ;3ZL5;1QQ2;3TJF;4QL9;3ZLP;3TJB;2V41;4MH2;2RII;3TJJ;2ZCT;3A5W;2PN8;4MH3;1YEP;3SBC;3TKP;2I81;1QMV;1X0R;1N8J;4RQX;4K1F;2C0D;2E2G;4FH8;1YF1;4MA9;2CV4;1ZYE;3A2X;1YEX;1YEX;2H66;2V2G;3WGX;3A2X	0.8255697869	35	1.7	4.6321525886

Chitin_bind_4	PF00379.22	1	107	Many insect cuticular proteins include a 35-36 amino acid motif known as the R&R consensus. The extensive conservation of this region led to the suggestion that it functions to bind chitin. Provocatively, it has no sequence similarity to the well-known cysteine-containing chitin-binding domain found in chitinases and some peritrophic membrane proteins. Chitin binding has been shown experimentally for this region [1]. Thus arthropods have two distinct classes of chitin binding proteins, those with the chitin-binding domain found in lectins, chitinases and peritrophic membranes (cysCBD) and those with the cuticular protein chitin-binding domain (non-cysCBD) [1].

PWWP	PF00855.16	1	225	The PWWP domain is named after a conserved Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro motif [1]. The domain binds to Histone-4 methylated at lysine-20, H4K20me, suggesting that it is methyl-lysine recognition motif. Removal of two conserved aromatic residues in a hydrophobic cavity created by this domain within the full-length protein, Pdp1, abolishes the interaction o f the protein with H4K20me3. In fission yeast, Set9 is the sole enzyme that catalyses all three states of H4K20me, and Set9-mediated H4K20me is required for efficient recruitment of checkpoint protein Crb2 to sites of DNA damage. The methylation of H4K20 is involved in a diverse array of cellular processes, such as organising higher-order chromatin, maintaining genome stability, and regulating cell-cycle progression [2].

CS	PF04969.15	1	72	The CS and CHORD (Pfam:PF04968) are fused into a single polypeptide chain in metazoans but are found in separate proteins in plants; this is thought to be indicative of an interaction between CS and CHORD [1]. It has been suggested that the CS domain is a binding module for HSP90, implying that CS domain-containing proteins are involved in recruiting heat shock proteins to multiprotein assemblies [2]. Two CS domains are found at the N-terminus of Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19 (USP19) (Swiss:O94966), these domains may play a role in the interaction of USP19 with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 [3].

Thioesterase	PF00975.19	1	20	Peptide synthetases are involved in the non-ribosomal synthesis of peptide antibiotics. Next to the operons encoding these enzymes, in almost all cases, are genes that encode proteins that have similarity to the type II fatty acid thioesterases of vertebrates. There are also modules within the peptide synthetases that also share this similarity. With respect to antibiotic production, thioesterases are required for the addition of the last amino acid to the peptide antibiotic, thereby forming a cyclic antibiotic. Thioesterases (non-integrated) have molecular masses of 25-29 kDa.

Dynein_heavy	PF03028.14	1	506	This family represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains [1]. The 380 kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380 kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained [2].

DDE_1	PF03184.18	1	13	This family of proteins are related to Pfam:PF00665 and are probably endonucleases of the DDE superfamily. Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. This domain is a member of the DDE superfamily, which contain three carboxylate residues that are believed to be responsible for coordinating metal ions needed for catalysis. The catalytic activity of this enzyme involves DNA cleavage at a specific site followed by a strand transfer reaction. Interestingly this family also includes the CENP-B protein. This domain in that protein appears to have lost the metal binding residues and is unlikely to have endonuclease activity. Centromere Protein B (CENP-B) is a DNA-binding protein localised to the centromere.	DDE_1	Family	3886	140.3	18	32.44	Changed	DDE superfamily endonuclease		1.3566868204	160	-19.7	-14.0413399857
Septin	PF00735.17	1	14	Members of this family include CDC3, CDC10, CDC11 and CDC12/Septin. Members of this family bind GTP. As regards the septins, these are polypeptides of 30-65kDa with three characteristic GTPase motifs (G-1, G-3 and G-4) that are similar to those of the Ras family. The G-4 motif is strictly conserved with a unique septin consensus of AKAD. Most septins are thought to have at least one coiled-coil region, which in some cases is necessary for intermolecular interactions that allow septins to polymerise to form rod-shaped complexes. In turn, these are arranged into tandem arrays to form filaments. They are multifunctional proteins, with roles in cytokinesis, sporulation, germ cell development, exocytosis and apoptosis [2].

DEP	PF00610.20	1	106	The DEP domain [1] is responsible for mediating intracellular protein targeting and regulation of protein stability in the cell [2-3]. The DEP domain is present in a number of signaling molecules, including Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins, and has been implicated in membrane targeting [4-5]. New findings in yeast, however, demonstrate a major role for a DEP domain in mediating the interaction of an RGS protein to the C-terminal tail of a GPCR, thus placing RGS in close proximity with its substrate G protein alpha subunit [6-7].

This family also includes 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) isomerase enzymes catalyse one step in prokaryotic polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) catabolic pathways [2,3,4]. This family also contains members with functions other than HCCA isomerisation, such as Kappa family GSTs (e.g. Swiss:P24473), whose similarity to HCCA isomerases was not previously recognised. The sequence Swiss:O07298 has been annotated as a dioxygenase but is almost certainly an HCCA isomerase enzyme. Similarly, the sequence Swiss:Q9ZI67 has been annotated as a dehydrogenase, but is most probably also an HCCA isomerase enzyme. In addition, the Rhizobium leguminosarum Swiss:Q52782 protein has been annotated as a putative glycerol-3-phosphate transfer protein, but is also most likely to be an HCCA isomerase enzyme (see [5]).

tRNA_U5-meth_tr	PF05958.10	0	8	This family consists of (Uracil-5-)-methyltransferases EC:2.1.1.35 from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. A 5-methyluridine (m(5)U) residue at position 54 is a conserved feature of bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs. The methylation of U54 is catalysed by the tRNA(m5U54)methyltransferase, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the nonessential TRM2 gene. It is thought that tRNA modification enzymes might have a role in tRNA maturation not necessarily linked to their known catalytic activity [1].	tRNA_U5-meth_tr	Family	3973	233.1	27	52.03	Changed	tRNA (Uracil-5-)-methyltransferase	1UWV;3BT7;2JJQ;2VS1;2BH2

SPX	PF03105.18	0	231	We have named this region the SPX domain after SYG1, Pho81 and XPR1. This 180 residue long domain is found at the amino terminus of a variety of proteins. In the yeast protein SYG1, the N-terminus directly binds to the G-protein beta subunit and inhibits transduction of the mating pheromone signal [3]. Similarly, the N-terminus of the human XPR1 protein binds directly to the beta subunit of the G-protein heterotrimer leading to increased production of cAMP. These findings suggest that all the members of this family are involved in G-protein associated signal transduction. The N-termini of several proteins involved in the regulation of phosphate transport, including the putative phosphate level sensors PHO81 Swiss:P17442 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and NUC-2 Swiss:Q01317 from Neurospora crassa, are also members of this family [4,5]. The SPX domain of S. cerevisiae low-affinity phosphate transporters Pho87 and Pho90 auto-regulates uptake and prevents efflux. This SPX dependent inhibition is mediated by the physical interaction with Spl2 [6] NUC-2 contains several ankyrin repeats Pfam:PF00023. Several members of this family are annotated as XPR1 proteins: the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor confers susceptibility to infection with murine xenotropic and polytropic leukaemia viruses (MLV) [1]. Infection by these retroviruses can inhibit XPR1-mediated cAMP signalling and result in cell toxicity and death [7]. The similarity between SYG1, phosphate regulators and XPR1 sequences has been previously noted, as has the additional similarity to several predicted proteins, of unknown function, from Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and many other diverse organisms [1,2,6,7]. In addition, given the similarities between XPR1 and SYG1 and phosphate regulatory proteins, it has been proposed that XPR1 might be involved in G-protein associated signal transduction and may itself function as a phosphate sensor [1].

HlyIII	PF03006.19	1	38	Members of this family are integral membrane proteins. This family includes a protein with hemolytic activity from Bacillus cereus [1]. It has been proposed that YOL002c encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that plays a key role in metabolic pathways that regulate lipid and phosphate metabolism [2]. In eukaryotes, members are seven-transmembrane pass molecules found to encode functional receptors with a broad range of apparent ligand specificities, including progestin and adipoQ receptors, and hence have been named PAQR proteins [3]. The mammalian members include progesterone binding proteins [4]. Unlike the case with GPCR receptor proteins, the evolutionary ancestry of the members of this family can be traced back to the Archaea. This family belongs to the CREST superfamily [5], which are distantly related to GPCRs.	HlyIII	Family	4117	208.9	23	68.92	Changed	Haemolysin-III related	3WXV;3WXW	0.9360616892	197	11.9	5.696505505

FeS_assembly_P	PF01883.18	1	42	This family has an alpha/beta topology, with 13 conserved hydrophobic residues at its core and a putative active site containing a highly conserved cysteine [1]. Members of this family are involved in a range of physiological functions. The family includes PaaJ (PhaH) Swiss:O84984 from Pseudomonas putida. PaaJ forms a complex with PaaG (PhaF) Swiss:O84982, PaaI (PhaG) Swiss:O84983 and PaaK (PhaI) Swiss:O84985, which hydroxylates phenylacetic acid to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid [2]. It also includes PaaD Swiss:P76080 from Escherichia coli, a member of a multicomponent oxygenase involved in phenylacetyl-CoA hydroxylation [3]. Furthermore, several members of this family are shown to be involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly. Iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are inorganic co-factors that are are able to transfer electrons and act as catalysts [5]. They are involved in diverse cellular processes including cellular respiration, DNA replication and repair, antibiotic resistance, and dinitrogen fixation [6]. The biogenesis of such clusters from elemental iron and sulfur is an enzymatic process that requires a set of specialised proteins. Proteins containing this domain include the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101), Swiss:Q6STH5, which has been described as an essential and specific factor for assembly of [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing protein complexes such as the membrane complex Photosystem I (PSI) and the heterodimeric FTR (ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase) complex [5] and is involved in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their transfer to apoproteins [4]. The mature HCF101 protein contains an N-terminal DUF59 domain as well as eight cysteine residues along the sequence. All cysteine residues are conserved among higher plants, but of the two cysteine residues located in the DUF59 domain only Cys128 is highly conserved and is present in the highly conserved P-loop domain of the plant HCF101 (CKGGVGKS) [5]. SufT protein from Staphylococcus aureus is composed of DUF59 solely and is shown to be involved in the maturation of FeS proteins [6]. Given all this data, it is hypothesised that DUF59 might play a role in FeS cluster assembly.

MtN3_slv	PF03083.15	1	21	This family includes proteins such as drosophila saliva [1], MtN3 involved in root nodule development [3] and a protein involved in activation and expression of recombination activation genes (RAGs) [2]. Although the molecular function of these proteins is unknown, they are almost certainly transmembrane proteins. This family contains a region of two transmembrane helices that is found in two copies in most members of the family. This family also contains specific sugar efflux transporters that are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development.

RNA_pol_L	PF01193.23	1	464	The two eukaryotic subunits Rpb3 and Rpb11 dimerise to from a platform onto which the other subunits of the RNA polymerase assemble (D/L in archaea). The prokaryotic equivalent of the Rpb3/Rpb11 platform is the alpha-alpha dimer. The dimerisation domain of the alpha subunit/Rpb3 is interrupted by an insert domain (Pfam:PF01000). Some of the alpha subunits also contain iron-sulphur binding domains (Pfam:PF00037). Rpb11 is found as a continuous domain. Members of this family include: alpha subunit from eubacteria, alpha subunits from chloroplasts, Rpb3 subunits from eukaryotes, Rpb11 subunits from eukaryotes, RpoD subunits from archaeal spp, and RpoL subunits from archaeal spp.	RNA_pol_L	Domain	4329	211.3	26	65.38	Changed	RNA polymerase Rpb3/Rpb11 dimerisation domain	3K1F;2E2H;1YNJ;4BXZ;4Q4Z;2VUM;4Q5S;3IYD;3WOD;3H0G;2JA7;1L9Z;1TWA;4OIQ;4ZH2;4G7Z;4YFX;4A3I;1TWC;4Y52;4LK1;2WAQ;3PO3;2BE5;4V1O;4YLP;1TWH;2E2J;2Y0S;1Y1Y;3GTG;2A69;2A6H;3S2D;2E2I;4A3F;2R7Z;2JA5;2B63;5C4X;2JA6;3S1Q;3H3V;3HOX;4C2M;4OIO;2PMZ;1SFO;1K83;3K7A;3M4O;4Y7N;4BBS;4BXX;1I3Q;2JA8;4NOI;4OIN;1Y1V;4V1N;3FKI;3J0K;3I4N;3S16;3HOU;2O5J;4MQ9;4LJZ;2GHO;4WQS;2NVQ;2NVT;1Y1W;3S17;2B8K;3GTL;3AOI;4WQT;3CQZ;4JK1;3HKZ;3EQL;1I50;1YNN;5C44;3I4M;3S15;3GTQ;4G7O;2NVX;3LU0;2WB1;4YG2;4LLG;5C4A;4OIP;1TWG;4LK0;4GZZ;3RZO;2R92;3GTP;2PPB;2PA8;3M3Y;4G7H;3HOV;3QT1;3S1N;4XSZ;1I6H;1NIK;1I6V;4XSX;1PQV;2A6E;2O5I;4X67;2YU9;3GTO;4ZH3;1R9S;1BDF;1NT9;1IW7;4YFN;4QJV;4A3G;4A3E;3HOZ;4YFK;1HQM;1Y77;3HOY;4X6A;2R93;4A93;4JK2;4BY7;4A3M;3GTM;4KMU;1R5U;1R9T;4JKR;4BBR;4A3C;4AYB;3AOH;4KN4;4C3J;4C3I;4KN7;2NVZ;4V1M;4MEY;3S1R;3DXJ;3RZD;4A3D;5C4J;1TWF;3GTJ;4OIR;4YLO;3S2H;4ZH4;1ZYR;3PO2;4QIW;1WCM;4S20;3HOW;4GZY;1SMY;4A3B;2A68;2CW0;4YLN;1L9U;4A3K;3J1N;2NVY;4V8S;3GTK;4A3J;4MEX;4BY1;4XSY;4BY1;4A3L;3S1M;3S14;4C3H;4XLQ;4XLS;4XLR;4XLP;4YM7;4XLN;5BYH	0.1761359905	126	85.3	40.369143398

PIP5K	PF01504.17	1	386	This family contains a region from the common kinase core found in the type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family as described in [1]. The family consists of various type I, II and III PIP5K enzymes. PIP5K catalyses the formation of phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate via the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate a precursor in the phosphinositide signaling pathway.

FGE-sulfatase	PF03781.15	1	22	This domain is found in eukaryotic proteins [1] required for post-translational sulfatase modification (SUMF1). These proteins are associated with the rare disorder multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) [2]. The protein product of the SUMF1 gene is FGE, formylglycine (FGly),-generating enzyme, which is a sulfatase. Sulfatases are enzymes essential for degradation and remodelling of sulfate esters, and formylglycine (FGly), the key catalytic in the active site, is unique to sulfatases [3]. FGE is localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with and modifies the unfolded form of newly synthesised sulfatases. FGE is a single-domain monomer with a surprising paucity of secondary structure that adopts a unique fold which is stabilised by two Ca2+ ions. The effect of all mutations found in MSD patients is explained by the FGE structure, providing a molecular basis for MSD. A redox-active disulfide bond is present in the active site of FGE. An oxidised cysteine residue, possibly cysteine sulfenic acid, has been detected that may allow formulation of a structure-based mechanism for FGly formation from cysteine residues in all sulfatases [4]. In Mycobacteria and Treponema denticola this enzyme functions as an iron(II)-dependent oxidoreductase [5,6].

It is called the PLAT (Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase, Alpha-Toxin) domain or LH2 (Lipoxygenase homology) domain. The known structure of pancreatic lipase shows this domain binds to procolipase Pfam:PF01114, which mediates membrane association. So it appears possible that this domain mediates membrane attachment via other protein binding partners. The structure of this domain is known for many members of the family and is composed of a beta sandwich.

Hemerythrin	PF01814.22	1	188	Iteration of the HHE family ([2]) found it to be related to Hemerythrin. It also demonstrated that what has been described as a single domain ([1]) in fact consists of two cation binding domains. Members of this family occur all across nature and are involved in a variety of processes. For instance, in Nereis diversicolor Swiss:P80255 binds Cadmium so as to protect the organism from toxicity ([3]). However Hemerythrin is classically described as Oxygen-binding through two attached Fe2+ ions. And the bacterial Swiss:Q7WX96 is a regulator of response to NO, which suggests yet another set-up for its metal ligands ([4]). In Staphylococcus aureus P72360 has been noted to be important when the organism switches to living in environments with low oxygen concentrations ([4]); perhaps this protein acts as an oxygen store or scavenger.

His_Phos_2	PF00328.21	1	43	The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches.The smaller branch 2 contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The catalytic functions in members include phytase, glucose-1-phosphatase and multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase. The in vivo roles of the mammalian acid phosphatases in branch 2 are not fully understood, although activity against lysophosphatidic acid and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins has been demonstrated.

Snf7	PF03357.20	1	33	This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localisation, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins [1]. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family.

NMO	PF03060.14	0	6	Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO), formerly referred to as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (NPD) (EC:1.13.11.32), is an FMN-dependent enzyme that uses molecular oxygen to oxidize (anionic) alkyl nitronates and, in the case of the enzyme from Neurospora crassa, (neutral) nitroalkanes to the corresponding carbonyl compounds and nitrite. Previously classified as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase [1,2,3], but it is now recognized that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes to their nitronate (anionic) forms [4]. The enzymes from the fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Williopsis saturnus var. mrakii (formerly classified as Hansenula mrakii) contain non-covalently bound FMN as the cofactor. Active towards linear alkyl nitronates of lengths between 2 and 6 carbon atoms and, with lower activity, towards propyl-2-nitronate. The enzyme from N. crassa can also utilize neutral nitroalkanes, but with lower activity. One atom of oxygen is incorporated into the carbonyl group of the aldehyde product. The reaction appears to involve the formation of an enzyme-bound nitronate radical and an a-peroxynitroethane species, which then decomposes, either in the active site of the enzyme or after release, to acetaldehyde and nitrite.

7tm_2	PF00002.23	1	29	This family is known as Family B, the secretin-receptor family or family 2 of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs).They have been described in many animal species, but not in plants, fungi or prokaryotes. Three distinct sub-families are recognised. Subfamily B1 contains classical hormone receptors, such as receptors for secretin and glucagon, that are all involved in cAMP-mediated signalling pathways. Subfamily B2 contains receptors with long extracellular N-termini, such as the leukocyte cell-surface antigen CD97 (Swiss:P48960); calcium-independent receptors for latrotoxin (such as Swiss:O94910), and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitors (such as Swiss:O14514) amongst others. Subfamily B3 includes Methuselah and other Drosophila proteins (e.g. Swiss:P83119). Other than the typical seven-transmembrane region, characteristic structural features include an amino-terminal extracellular domain involved in ligand binding, and an intracellular loop (IC3) required for specific G-protein coupling [1].	7tm_2	Family	5681	225.2	22	27.91	Changed	7 transmembrane receptor (Secretin family)	4L6R;4K5Y;4K5Y	0.8871506294	231	-5.8	-2.5754884547

This may be a family of flavocytochromes capable of moving electrons across the plasma membrane [1]. The Frp1 protein Swiss:Q04800 from S. pombe is a ferric reductase component and is required for cell surface ferric reductase activity, mutants in frp1 are deficient in ferric iron uptake [1]. Cytochrome B-245 heavy chain Swiss:P04839 is a FAD-dependent dehydrogenase it is also has electron transferase activity which reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide anion, a precursor in the production of microbicidal oxidants [2]. Mutations in the sequence of cytochrome B-245 heavy chain (gp91-phox) lead to the X-linked chronic granulomatous disease. The bacteriocidal ability of phagocytic cells is reduced and is characterised by the absence of a functional plasma membrane associated NADPH oxidase [3]. The chronic granulomatous disease gene codes for the beta chain of cytochrome B-245 and cytochrome B-245 is missing from patients with the disease [4].

BPL_LplA_LipB	PF03099.18	1	18	This family includes biotin protein ligase, lipoate-protein ligase A and B. Biotin is covalently attached at the active site of certain enzymes that transfer carbon dioxide from bicarbonate to organic acids to form cellular metabolites. Biotin protein ligase (BPL) is the enzyme responsible for attaching biotin to a specific lysine at the active site of biotin enzymes. Each organism probably has only one BPL. Biotin attachment is a two step reaction that results in the formation of an amide linkage between the carboxyl group of biotin and the epsilon-amino group of the modified lysine [2]. Lipoate-protein ligase A (LPLA) catalyses the formation of an amide linkage between lipoic acid and a specific lysine residue in lipoate dependent enzymes [3]. The unusual biosynthesis pathway of lipoic acid is mechanistically intertwined with attachment of the cofactor [5].

Ank	PF00023.29	1	1063	Ankyrins are multifunctional adaptors that link specific proteins to the membrane-associated, spectrin- actin cytoskeleton. This repeat-domain is a 'membrane-binding' domain of up to 24 repeated units, and it mediates most of the protein's binding activities. Repeats 13-24 are especially active, with known sites of interaction for the Na/K ATPase, Cl/HCO(3) anion exchanger, voltage-gated sodium channel, clathrin heavy chain and L1 family cell adhesion molecules. The ANK repeats are found to form a contiguous spiral stack such that ion transporters like the anion exchanger associate in a large central cavity formed by the ANK repeat spiral, while clathrin and cell adhesion molecules associate with specific regions outside this cavity [2][3].

PQ-loop	PF04193.13	1	220	Members of this family are all membrane bound proteins possessing a pair of repeats each spanning two transmembrane helices connected by a loop [1]. The PQ motif found on loop 2 is critical for the localisation of cystinosin to lysosomes [2]. However, the PQ motif appears not to be a general lysosome-targeting motif. It is thought likely to possess a more general function. Most probably this involves a glutamine residue [1]. Family members are membrane transporters since two members, cystinosin and PQLC2, transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane [3]. The 2nd PQ-loop of cystinosin hosts the substrate-coupled H+ binding site underlying its H+ symport mechanism, suggesting that PQ-loop repeats have functional significance [4,5]. It is thus likely that PQ-loop-containing proteins act as a family of membrane transporters. Some transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane.

The structure of I-TevI a GIY-YIG endonuclease, reveals a novel alpha/beta-fold with a central three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet flanked by three helices [4].

On the basis of the experimentally demonstrated activity of the Methanobacterium phage pseudomurein endoisopeptidase [2], it is proposed that many, if not all, microbial homologues of the transglutaminases are proteases and that the eukaryotic transglutaminases have evolved from an ancestral protease.

BRCT	PF00533.25	1	83	The BRCT domain is found predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage. The BRCT domain of XRCC1 forms a homodimer in the crystal structure. This suggests that pairs of BRCT domains associate as homo- or heterodimers. BRCT domains are often found as tandem-repeat pairs [2]. Structures of the BRCA1 BRCT domains revealed a basis for a widely utilised head-to-tail BRCT-BRCT oligomerisation mode [3]. This conserved tandem BRCT architecture facilitates formation of the canonical BRCT phospho-peptide interaction cleft at a groove between the BRCT domains. Disease associated missense and nonsense mutations in the BRCA1 BRCT domains disrupt peptide binding by directly occluding this peptide binding groove, or by disrupting key conserved BRCT core folding determinants [5].

Abi	PF02517.15	1	807	Members of this family are probably proteases (after a isoprenyl group is attached to the Cys residue in the C-terminal CAAX motif of a protein to attach it to the membrane, the AAX tripeptide being removed by one of the CAAX prenyl proteases). The family contains the Swiss:Q03530 CAAX prenyl protease. The proteins contain a highly conserved Glu-Glu motif at the amino end of the alignment. The alignment also contains two histidine residues that may be involved in zinc binding [1]. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes where they are probably involved in self-immunity. Investigation of the bacteriocin-like loci in the Gram positive bacteria locus from Lactobacillus sakei 23K confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (sak23Kalphabeta) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (sak23Ki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Interestingly, the immunity genes from three similar systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of Sak23Ki - thus a new concept in self-immunity [2].

hEGF	PF12661.6	1	361	hEGF, or human growth factor-like EGF, domains have six conserved residues disulfide-bonded into the characteristic 'ababcc' pattern. They are involved in growth and proliferation of cells, in proteins of the Notch/Delta pathway, neurogulin and selectins. hEGFs are also found in mosaic proteins with four-disulfide laminin EGFs such as aggrecan and perlecan. The core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small beta-hairpins packed against each other. Two major structural variants have been identified based on the structural context of the C-terminal Cys residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In hEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides in the beta-turn, resulting in shorter loop-lengths between the Cys residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[8-9]XC. These shorter loop-lengths are also typical of the four-disulfide EGF domains, laminin ad integrin. Tandem hEGF domains have six linking residues between terminal cysteines of adjacent domains. hEGF domains may or may not bind calcium in the linker region. hEGF domains with the consensus motif CXD4X[F,Y]XCXC are hydroxylated exclusively in the Asp residue.	hEGF	Domain	6676	21.1	41	3.25	Changed	Human growth factor-like EGF	2P28;2P28;2YGQ;2YGQ;2YGQ;2GY7;2GY5	0.2420788364	18	3.1	14.691943128

Dus	PF01207.16	0	16	Members of this family catalyse the reduction of the 5,6-double bond of a uridine residue on tRNA. Dihydrouridine modification of tRNA is widely observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and also in some archae. Most dihydrouridines are found in the D loop of t-RNAs. The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA. It is likely that different family members have different substrate specificities, which may overlap. Dus 1 (Swiss:Q9HGN6) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts on pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 (Swiss:P53720) acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr and pre-tRNA-Leu. Dus 1 is active as a single subunit, requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of FAD [1]. Some family members may be targeted to the mitochondria and even have a role in mitochondria [1].

Putative_PNPOx	PF01243.19	1	124	Family of domains with putative PNPOx function. Family members were predicted to encode pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase, based on sequence similarity. However, there is no experimental data to validate the predicted activity and purified proteins, such as Swiss:Q06199 and its paralogs, do not possess this activity, nor do they bind to flavin mononucleotide (FMN). To date, the only time functional oxidase activity has been experimentally demonstrated is when the sequences contain both Pfam:PF01243 and Pfam:PF10590. Moreover, some of the family members that contain both domains have been shown to be involved in phenazine biosynthesis. While some molecular function has been experimentally validated for the proteins containing both domains, the role performed by each domain on its own is unknown [1].

DAGK_cat	PF00781.23	1	110	Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a second messenger that acts as a protein kinase C activator. The catalytic domain is assumed from the finding of bacterial homologues. YegS is the Escherichia coli protein in this family whose crystal structure reveals an active site in the inter-domain cleft formed by four conserved sequence motifs, revealing a novel metal-binding site. The residues of this site are conserved across the family [5].

Included in this family are the Rhizobial NodU proteins and the HypF regulator. This region also contains the histidine dyad believed to coordinate the metal ion and hence provide catalytic activity. Interestingly the histidines are not well conserved, and there is a lack of experimental evidence to support peptidase activity as a general property of this family. There also appear to be instances of this domain outside of the HSP70-actin superfamily (e.g. Swiss:Q9ZM49).

PA	PF02225.21	1	401	The PA (Protease associated) domain is found as an insert domain in diverse proteases. The PA domain is also found in a plant vacuolar sorting receptor Swiss:O22925 and members of the RZF family Swiss:O43567. It has been suggested that this domain forms a lid-like structure that covers the active site in active proteases, and is involved in protein recognition in vacuolar sorting receptors [1].

TGS	PF02824.20	1	55	The TGS domain is named after ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT [1]. Interestingly, TGS domain was detected also at the amino terminus of the uridine kinase from the spirochaete Treponema pallidum (but not any other organism, including the related spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi). TGS is a small domain that consists of ~50 amino acid residues and is predicted to possess a predominantly beta-sheet structure. There is no direct information on the functions of the TGS domain, but its presence in two types of regulatory proteins (the GTPases and guanosine polyphosphate phosphohydrolases/synthetases) suggests a ligand (most likely nucleotide)-binding, regulatory role [1].

BPTI (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) is an extensively studied model structure. Certain family members are similar to the tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP, Swiss:P17726). This is a highly selective inhibitor of factor Xa in the blood coagulation pathways [1]. TAP molecules are highly dipolar [2], and are arranged to form a twisted two- stranded antiparallel beta-sheet followed by an alpha helix [1].

Hpt	PF01627.22	0	229	The histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain is a novel protein module with an active histidine residue that mediates phosphotransfer reactions in the two-component signaling systems. A multistep phosphorelay involving the HPt domain has been suggested for these signaling pathways. The crystal structure of the HPt domain of the anaerobic sensor kinase ArcB has been determined [1]. The domain consists of six alpha helices containing a four-helix bundle-folding. The pattern of sequence similarity of the HPt domains of ArcB and components in other signaling systems can be interpreted in light of the three-dimensional structure and supports the conclusion that the HPt domains have a common structural motif both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae ypd1p this domain has been shown to contain a binding surface for Ssk1p (response regulator receiver domain containing protein Pfam:PF00072) [2].

FAA_hydrolase	PF01557.17	1	53	This family consists of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase, or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and it also includes HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase from E. coli strain W. FAA is the last enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, it hydrolyses fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate which then join the citric acid cycle [1]. Mutations in FAA cause type I tyrosinemia in humans this is an inherited disorder mainly affecting the liver leading to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal tubular damages and neurologic crises amongst other symptoms [1]. The enzymatic defect causes the toxic accumulation of phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolites [3]. The E. coli W enzyme HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase contains two copies of this domain and functions in fourth and fifth steps of the homoprotocatechuate pathway; here it decarboxylates OPET to HHDD and isomerises this to OHED. The final products of this pathway are pyruvic acid and succinic semialdehyde. This family also includes various hydratases and 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylases which are involved in the bacterial meta-cleavage pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds. 2-hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase encoded by mhpD in E. coli Swiss:P77608 is involved in the phenylpropionic acid pathway of E. coli and catalyses the conversion of 2-hydroxy pentadienoate to 4-hydroxy-2-keto-pentanoate and uses a Mn2+ co-factor [5]. OHED hydratase encoded by hpcG in E. coli Swiss:P42270 is involved in the homoprotocatechuic acid (HPC) catabolism [6]. XylI in P. putida Swiss:P49155 is a 4-Oxalocrotonate decarboxylase [7].

DHHC	PF01529.19	1	74	This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases [1]. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein [2][3]. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein [4], Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein [5], Mammalian ZDHHC9 [6], Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1 [7], Yeast Erf2 protein [8], and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1 [9].	zf-DHHC	Family	7883	128.2	27	30.45	Changed	DHHC palmitoyltransferase		0.8453930309	126	2.2	1.7160686427

CAP	PF00188.25	1	94	This is a large family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) that are found in a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotes [2] and non-vertebrate eukaryotes [3], The nine subfamilies of the mammalian CAP 'super'family include: the human glioma pathogenesis-related 1 (GLIPR1), Golgi associated pathogenesis related-1 (GAPR1) proteins, peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15), peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), CRISP LCCL domain containing 1 (CRISPLD1), CRISP LCCL domain containing 2 (CRISPLD2), mannose receptor like and the R3H domain containing like proteins. Members are most often secreted and have an extracellular endocrine or paracrine function and are involved in processes including the regulation of extracellular matrix and branching morphogenesis, potentially as either proteases or protease inhibitors; in ion channel regulation in fertility; as tumour suppressor or pro-oncogenic genes in tissues including the prostate; and in cell-cell adhesion during fertilisation. The overall protein structural conservation within the CAP 'super'family results in fundamentally similar functions for the CAP domain in all members, yet the diversity outside of this core region dramatically alters the target specificity and, thus, the biological consequences [4]. The Ca++-chelating function [3] would fit with the various signalling processes (e.g. the CRISP proteins) that members of this family are involved in, and also the sequence and structural evidence of a conserved pocket containing two histidines and a glutamate. It also may explain how Swiss:Q91055 blocks the Ca++ transporting ryanodine receptors.

IBR	PF01485.20	1	160	The IBR (In Between Ring fingers) domain is often found to occur between pairs of ring fingers (Pfam:PF00097). This domain has also been called the C6HC domain and DRIL (for double RING finger linked) domain [2]. Proteins that contain two Ring fingers and an IBR domain (these proteins are also termed RBR family proteins) are thought to exist in all eukaryotic organisms. RBR family members play roles in protein quality control and can indirectly regulate transcription [3]. Evidence suggests that RBR proteins are often parts of cullin-containing ubiquitin ligase complexes. The ubiquitin ligase Parkin is an RBR family protein whose mutations are involved in forms of familial Parkinson's disease [3][4].

Stringent starvation proteins in E. coli are also included in the alignment but are not known to have GST activity. The glutathione molecule binds in a cleft between N and C-terminal domains. The catalytically important residues are proposed to reside in the N-terminal domain [1]. In plants, GSTs are encoded by a large gene family (48 GST genes in Arabidopsis) and can be divided into the phi, tau, theta, zeta, and lambda classes [2].

Patatin	PF01734.21	1	111	This family consists of various patatin glycoproteins from plants. The patatin protein accounts for up to 40% of the total soluble protein in potato tubers [2]. Patatin is a storage protein but it also has the enzymatic activity of lipid acyl hydrolase, catalysing the cleavage of fatty acids from membrane lipids [2]. Members of this family have been found also in vertebrates.

KRAB	PF01352.26	1	584	The KRAB domain (or Kruppel-associated box) is present in about a third of zinc finger proteins containing C2H2 fingers. The KRAB domain is found to be involved in protein-protein interactions [2,3]. The KRAB domain is generally encoded by two exons. The regions coded by the two exons are known as KRAB-A and KRAB-B. The A box plays an important role in repression by binding to corepressors, while the B box is thought to enhance this repression brought about by the A box. KRAB-containing proteins are thought to have critical functions in cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis and neoplastic transformation [4].

LSM	PF01423.21	1	112	The LSM domain contains Sm proteins as well as other related LSM (Like Sm) proteins. The U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing contain seven Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F and G) in common, which assemble around the Sm site present in four of the major spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs. The U6 snRNP binds to the LSM (Like Sm) proteins [3]. Sm proteins are also found in archaebacteria, which do not have any splicing apparatus suggesting a more general role for Sm proteins. All Sm proteins contain a common sequence motif in two segments, Sm1 and Sm2, separated by a short variable linker. This family also includes the bacterial Hfq (host factor Q) proteins.

Tubulin	PF00091.24	1	88	This family includes the tubulin alpha, beta and gamma chains, as well as the bacterial FtsZ family of proteins. Members of this family are involved in polymer formation. FtsZ is the polymer-forming protein of bacterial cell division. It is part of a ring in the middle of the dividing cell that is required for constriction of cell membrane and cell envelope to yield two daughter cells. FtsZ and tubulin are GTPases. FtsZ can polymerise into tubes, sheets, and rings in vitro and is ubiquitous in eubacteria and archaea. Tubulin is the major component of microtubules.

Proton_antipo_M	PF00361.19	1	14	This is a family of membrane transporters that inlcudes some 7 of potentially 14-16 TM regions. In many instances the family forms part of complex I that catalyses the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in a reaction that is associated with proton translocation across the membrane, and in this context is a combination predominantly of subunits 2, 4, 5, 14, L, M and N [1]. In many bacterial species these proteins are probable stand-alone transporters not coupled with oxidoreduction [2]. The family in total represents homologues across the phyla.

SMC_N	PF02463.18	1	28	This domain is found at the N terminus of SMC proteins. The SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) superfamily proteins have ATP-binding domains at the N- and C-termini, and two extended coiled-coil domains separated by a hinge in the middle. The eukaryotic SMC proteins form two kind of heterodimers: the SMC1/SMC3 and the SMC2/SMC4 types. These heterodimers constitute an essential part of higher order complexes, which are involved in chromatin and DNA dynamics [1]. This family also includes the RecF and RecN proteins that are involved in DNA metabolism and recombination.

RNase_PH	PF01138.20	1	159	This family includes 3'-5' exoribonucleases. Ribonuclease PH contains a single copy of this domain, and removes nucleotide residues following the -CCA terminus of tRNA. Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (PNPase) contains two tandem copies of the domain. PNPase is involved in mRNA degradation in a 3'-5' direction. The exosome is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex that is required for 3' processing of the 5.8S rRNA. Three of its five protein components, Swiss:P46948 Swiss:Q12277 and Swiss:P25359 contain a copy of this domain [1]. Swiss:Q10205, a hypothetical protein from S. pombe appears to belong to an uncharacterised subfamily. This subfamily is found in both eukaryotes and archaebacteria.

Toprim	PF01751.21	1	135	This is a conserved region from DNA primase. This corresponds to the Toprim domain common to DnaG primases, topoisomerases, OLD family nucleases and RecR proteins [1]. Both DnaG motifs IV and V are present in the alignment, the DxD (V) motif may be involved in Mg2+ binding and mutations to the conserved glutamate (IV) completely abolish DnaG type primase activity [1]. DNA primase EC:2.7.7.6 is a nucleotidyltransferase it synthesises the oligoribonucleotide primers required for DNA replication on the lagging strand of the replication fork; it can also prime the leading stand and has been implicated in cell division [2]. This family also includes the atypical archaeal A subunit from type II DNA topoisomerases [4]. Type II DNA topoisomerases catalyse the relaxation of DNA supercoiling by causing transient double strand breaks.

GAF	PF01590.25	1	442	This domain is present in cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, phytochromes, FhlA and NifA. Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases catalyse ATP and GTP to the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, respectively, these products up-regulating catalytic activity by binding to the regulatory GAF domain(s). The opposite hydrolysis reaction is catalysed by phosphodiesterase. cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase catalyses the conversion of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate to guanosine 5'-phosphate. Here too, cGMP regulates catalytic activity by GAF-domain binding. Phytochromes are regulatory photoreceptors in plants and bacteria which exist in two thermally-stable states that are reversibly inter-convertible by light: the Pr state absorbs maximally in the red region of the spectrum, while the Pfr state absorbs maximally in the far-red region. This domain is also found in FhlA (formate hydrogen lyase transcriptional activator) and NifA, a transcriptional activator which is required for activation of most Nif operons which are directly involved in nitrogen fixation. NifA interacts with sigma-54.

Proteasome	PF00227.25	1	157	The proteasome is a multisubunit structure that degrades proteins. Protein degradation is an essential component of regulation because proteins can become misfolded, damaged, or unnecessary. Proteasomes and their homologues vary greatly in complexity: from HslV (heat shock locus v), which is encoded by 1 gene in bacteria, to the eukaryotic 20S proteasome, which is encoded by more than 14 genes [1]. Recently evidence of two novel groups of bacterial proteasomes was proposed. The first is Anbu, which is sparsely distributed among cyanobacteria and proteobacteria [1]. The second is call beta-proteobacteria proteasome homologue (BPH) [1].

tRNA_anti-codon	PF01336.24	1	558	This family contains OB-fold domains that bind to nucleic acids [4]. The family includes the anti-codon binding domain of lysyl, aspartyl, and asparaginyl -tRNA synthetases (See Pfam:PF00152). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyse the addition of an amino acid to the appropriate tRNA molecule EC:6.1.1.-. This family also includes part of RecG helicase involved in DNA repair. Replication factor A is a hetero-trimeric complex, that contains a subunit in this family [2,3]. This domain is also found at the C-terminus of bacterial DNA polymerase III alpha chain.	tRNA_anti-codon	Domain	12922	81.7	21	13.46	Changed	OB-fold nucleic acid binding domain	4EX5;1KRS;1JMC;4YCU;4OWX;3DM3;3U4V;3AU7;4OWW;2MNA;1BBW;4AH6;1BBU;1YNX;1X54;4JOI;1WYD;4YCV;4GN3;1N9W;1E1O;2XGT;3AMU;1ASZ;4PG3;3E9I;4GNX;4GNX;4DPG;3BJU;1EOV;1FGU;4UP9;1EFW;4J15;1C0A;1B8A;4GN4;3NEN;4GN5;1O7I;3AMT;2K50;4GLV;3M4P;1E22;4GLA;4WJ3;3U58;2K5V;1X55;4GOP;4GOP;2XTI;4RMF;1LYL;3NEM;1G51;4YCW;1EQR;4UPA;3M4Q;4UP8;4OWT;1KRT;3E0E;3NEL;1L0W;1IL2;4RVZ;4WJ4;1E24;3E9H;4O2D;4H02;1ASY;4UP7;3KFU;1E1T;1X56;3A74	0.1692315327	72	9.7	11.8727050184

PUF	PF00806.18	1	50	Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. Swiss:P47135, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognise all 8 repeats in all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure [3,4].

Na_H_Exchanger	PF00999.20	1	60	Na/H antiporters are key transporters in maintaining the pH of actively metabolising cells. The molecular mechanisms of antiport are unclear. These antiporters contain 10-12 transmembrane regions (M) at the amino-terminus and a large cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl terminus. The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region has little similarity throughout the family.

Pro_isomerase	PF00160.20	1	73	The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, also known as cyclophilins, share this domain of about 109 amino acids. Cyclophilins have been found in all organisms studied so far and catalyse peptidyl-prolyl isomerisation during which the peptide bond preceding proline (the peptidyl-prolyl bond) is stabilised in the cis conformation. Mammalian cyclophilin A (CypA) is a major cellular target for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Other roles for cyclophilins may include chaperone and cell signalling function [1].

This important enzyme initiates both the urea cycle and the biosynthesis of arginine and/or pyrimidines [2]. The carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPS) enzyme in prokaryotes is a heterodimer of a small and large chain. The small chain promotes the hydrolysis of glutamine to ammonia, which is used by the large chain to synthesise carbamoyl phosphate. See Pfam:PF00988. The small chain has a GATase domain in the carboxyl terminus. See Pfam:PF00117. The ATP binding domain (this one) has an ATP-grasp fold.

SET	PF00856.27	1	257	SET domains are protein lysine methyltransferase enzymes. SET domains appear to be protein-protein interaction domains. It has been demonstrated that SET domains mediate interactions with a family of proteins that display similarity with dual-specificity phosphatases (dsPTPases) [2]. A subset of SET domains have been called PR domains. These domains are divergent in sequence from other SET domains, but also appear to mediate protein-protein interaction [3]. The SET domain consists of two regions known as SET-N and SET-C. SET-C forms an unusual and conserved knot-like structure of probably functional importance. Additionally to SET-N and SET-C, an insert region (SET-I) and flanking regions of high structural variability form part of the overall structure [5].

ketoacyl-synt	PF00109.25	1	81	The structure of beta-ketoacyl synthase is similar to that of the thiolase family (Pfam:PF00108) and also chalcone synthase. The active site of beta-ketoacyl synthase is located between the N and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain contains most of the structures involved in dimer formation and also the active site cysteine [1].	ketoacyl-synt	Domain	15905	232.8	26	18.23	Changed	Beta-ketoacyl synthase, N-terminal domain	4F32;4C73;3MQD;4JB6;1TQY;1TQY;1OX0;4OPF;3HHD;2ALM;3I8P;3G0Y;4V8V;2RJT;4DDO;2IWZ;1B3N;2BZ3;4QYR;4V8W;4V58;2VZ8;1W0I;1OXH;3U0E;4QAV;2AQB;1E5M;2AQ7;4JPF;4JV3;4V59;1F91;2GP6;4C72;1H4F;2WGG;4LS5;1J3N;3E60;2VB7;2VB7;4OPE;2CDH;3O04;1FJ8;3HMJ;2VBA;4MZ0;2IWY;2QO3;3HO9;1EK4;4NA2;4B7V;2PFF;2WGD;4C71;2CF2;4V8L;2GQD;4C70;4KC5;4TKT;2GFW;2IX4;4WKY;4NA3;2BZ4;3HO2;4JRH;2BUH;4NA1;4C6Z;4JRM;2BYW;4C6V;3G11;4C6W;2BYY;4EWG;2GFX;4OQJ;2C9H;4ZDN;4LS6;2GFY;4XOX;2VB8;2BYX;1KAS;3HNZ;2HG4;2GFV;4LS8;2VZ9;4R8E;1G5X;4C6X;3KZU;2BYZ;2VKZ;3LRF;2UV8;3OYT;1DD8;4LS7;1FJ4;3U0F;4C6U;4JGA;2BUI;4CW4;2WGE;2VB9	0.653186357	224	8.8	3.7800687285
CH	PF00307.30	1	122	The CH domain is found in both cytoskeletal proteins and signal transduction proteins [1]. The CH domain is involved in actin binding in some members of the family. However in calponins there is evidence that the CH domain is not involved in its actin binding activity [4]. Most member proteins have from two to four copies of the CH domain, however some proteins such as calponin and Swiss:P15498 have only a single copy.

FAD_binding_4	PF01565.22	1	128	This family consists of various enzymes that use FAD as a co-factor, most of the enzymes are similar to oxygen oxidoreductase. One of the enzymes Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) has a solved structure, the alignment includes the FAD binding site, called the PP-loop, between residues 99-110 [1]. The FAD molecule is covalently bound in the known structure, however the residue that links to the FAD is not in the alignment. VAO catalyses the oxidation of a wide variety of substrates, ranging form aromatic amines to 4-alkylphenols. Other members of this family include D-lactate dehydrogenase, this enzyme catalyses the conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate using FAD as a co-factor; mitomycin radical oxidase, this enzyme oxidises the reduced form of mitomycins and is involved in mitomycin resistance. This family includes MurB an UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase enzyme EC:1.1.1.158. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan [2].

F-box	PF00646.32	1	432	This domain is approximately 50 amino acids long, and is usually found in the N-terminal half of a variety of proteins. Two motifs that are commonly found associated with the F-box domain are the leucine rich repeats (LRRs; Pfam:PF00560 and Pfam:PF07723) and the WD repeat (Pfam:PF00400). The F-box domain has a role in mediating protein-protein interactions in a variety of contexts, such as polyubiquitination, transcription elongation, centromere binding and translational repression [3].

Hydrolase	PF00702.25	1	227	This family is structurally different from the alpha/beta hydrolase family (Pfam:PF00561). This family includes L-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolases and phosphatases. The structure of the family consists of two domains. One is an inserted four helix bundle, which is the least well conserved region of the alignment, between residues 16 and 96 of Swiss:P24069. The rest of the fold is composed of the core alpha/beta domain [1]. Those members with the characteristic DxD triad at the N-terminus are probably phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) phosphatases involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis in the mitochondria [2].

HTH_3	PF01381.21	1	175	This large family of DNA binding helix-turn helix proteins includes Cro Swiss:P03036 and CI Swiss:P03034. Within the protein Swiss:Q5F9C2, the full protein fold incorporates a helix-turn-helix motif, but the function of this member is unlikely to be that of a DNA-binding regulator, the function of most other members, so is not necessarily characteristic of the whole family [1].

BTB	PF00651.30	1	84	The BTB (for BR-C, ttk and bab) [1] or POZ (for Pox virus and Zinc finger) [2] domain is present near the N-terminus of a fraction of zinc finger (Pfam:PF00096) proteins and in proteins that contain the Pfam:PF01344 motif such as Kelch and a family of pox virus proteins. The BTB/POZ domain mediates homomeric dimerisation and in some instances heteromeric dimerisation [2]. The structure of the dimerised PLZF BTB/POZ domain has been solved and consists of a tightly intertwined homodimer. The central scaffolding of the protein is made up of a cluster of alpha-helices flanked by short beta-sheets at both the top and bottom of the molecule [3]. POZ domains from several zinc finger proteins have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes including N-CoR and SMRT [4,5,6]. The POZ or BTB domain is also known as BR-C/Ttk or ZiN.

Kelch_1	PF01344.24	1	147	The kelch motif was initially discovered in Kelch (Swiss:Q04652). In this protein there are six copies of the motif. It has been shown that Swiss:Q04652 is related to Galactose Oxidase [1] for which a structure has been solved [2]. The kelch motif forms a beta sheet. Several of these sheets associate to form a beta propeller structure as found in Pfam:PF00064, Pfam:PF00400 and Pfam:PF00415.

Spectrin	PF00435.20	1	80	Spectrin repeat-domains are found in several proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure. These include spectrin, alpha-actinin and dystrophin. The sequence repeat used in this family is taken from the structural repeat in reference [2]. The spectrin domain- repeat forms a three helix bundle. The second helix is interrupted by proline in some sequences. The repeats are defined by a characteristic tryptophan (W) residue at position 17 in helix A and a leucine (L) at 2 residues from the carboxyl end of helix C. Although the domain occurs in multiple repeats along sequences, the domains are actually stable on their own - ie they act, biophysically, like domains rather than repeats that along function when aggregated.

EGF	PF00008.26	1	67	There is no clear separation between noise and signal. Pfam:PF00053 is very similar, but has 8 instead of 6 conserved cysteines. Includes some cytokine receptors. The EGF domain misses the N-terminus regions of the Ca2+ binding EGF domains (this is the main reason of discrepancy between swiss-prot domain start/end and Pfam). The family is hard to model due to many similar but different sub-types of EGF domains. Pfam certainly misses a number of EGF domains.

7tm_1	PF00001.20	1	64	This family contains, amongst other G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs), members of the opsin family, which have been considered to be typical members of the rhodopsin superfamily. They share several motifs, mainly the seven transmembrane helices, GCPRs of the rhodopsin superfamily. All opsins bind a chromophore, such as 11-cis-retinal. The function of most opsins other than the photoisomerases is split into two steps: light absorption and G-protein activation. Photoisomerases, on the other hand, are not coupled to G-proteins - they are thought to generate and supply the chromophore that is used by visual opsins [1].	7tm_1	Family	31273	254.2	18	68.24	Changed	7 transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family)	4XES;1U19;4XT3;4PHU;3D4S;3DQB;2I35;3UZC;4LDL;4U15;4BEZ;4MQT;3OE8;4AMJ;4N6H;4DJH;4XNV;2Y00;3UZA;2Z73;4J4Q;3PDS;4A4M;3V2W;3VG9;3SN6;2YCY;2PED;2Y02;3CAP;3UON;3KJ6;2KSA;4MBS;4PXF;3OE6;2VT4;4LDO;3V2Y;4BUO;4NC3;5C1M;3PBL;1F88;4Z34;4YAY;3NYA;4RWA;3OE0;4EJ4;4NTJ;3PWH;3ODU;3NY8;4UHR;3QAK;4RWS;3ZPR;4AMI;4Z35;4UG2;4XT1;2ZIY;3VW7;4QKX;2R4R;2RH1;3ZEV;3NY9;2X72;4WW3;1HZX;2YCX;4LDE;4PXZ;2YDO;2YCW;4GPO;4GBR;3EML;3PXO;4BVN;2R4S;4BEY;2HPY;3C9L;4XNW;4MQS;4ZWJ;3OE9;4DAJ;2I37;3P0G;2LNL;3RZE;2YCZ;3VGA;2G87;2KSB;2I36;3ZPQ;2Y03;3PQR;4EIY;3AYM;4U16;3AYN;4IB4;4GRV;4Z36;3OAX;1LN6;2KS9;4DKL;2YDV;4BWB;3REY;4XEE;4BV0;3RFM;4IAQ;2Y04;4IAR;1JFP;4S0V;1HLL;1HOF;1L9H;4RWD;1GZM;3C9M;2Y01;4PY0;4EA3;1GZM;4U14;2J4Y;4RWD;3C9M;5A8E;4ZUD;5DHG;5DHH	0.7991574004	222	32.2	12.667191188

Collagen	PF01391.17	1	41	Members of this family belong to the collagen superfamily [1]. Collagens are generally extracellular structural proteins involved in formation of connective tissue structure. The alignment contains 20 copies of the G-X-Y repeat that forms a triple helix. The first position of the repeat is glycine, the second and third positions can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxy-proline. Collagens are post translationally modified by proline hydroxylase to form the hydroxy-proline residues. Defective hydroxylation is the cause of scurvy. Some members of the collagen superfamily are not involved in connective tissue structure but share the same triple helical structure. The family includes bacterial collagen-like triple-helix repeat proteins [2,3].

CBS	PF00571.27	1	840	CBS domains are small intracellular modules that pair together to form a stable globular domain [2]. This family represents a single CBS domain. Pairs of these domains have been termed a Bateman domain [6]. CBS domains have been shown to bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as AMP, ATP and S-AdoMet [5]. CBS domains are found attached to a wide range of other protein domains suggesting that CBS domains may play a regulatory role making proteins sensitive to adenosyl carrying ligands. The region containing the CBS domains in Cystathionine-beta synthase is involved in regulation by S-AdoMet [4]. CBS domain pairs from AMPK bind AMP or ATP [5]. The CBS domains from IMPDH and the chloride channel CLC2 bind ATP [5].

p450	PF00067.21	1	50	Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins [6] involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds. They are particularly well known for their role in the degradation of environmental toxins and mutagens. They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyse regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures [6].	p450	Domain	62234	345.1	17	79.68	Changed	Cytochrome P450	1LG9;1IWJ;1CMJ;1CMJ;1F4T;2IAG;1AKD;4B7D;1EGY;1NOO;2NZ5;3SN5;2X5L;1ODO;1ODO;4JWU;1N97;2GR6;4DUB;3P3L;3VRM;4CK9;3CXZ;1F26;1F26;1PHA;2XKR;4UYM;2FRZ;3GW9;4BF4;2CP4;4CP4;2X80;2FDU;4WNW;1U13;1OG2;2CPP;3WRL;4J14;3R1A;4CKA;3PM0;2M56;4BJK;2CA0;3B4X;4I8V;1MPW;1YRD;1WIY;3CV9;2F9Q;2BZ9;2WH8;4KTK;4C0C;4NKW;1OG5;2DKK;4PXH;1PHF;4C9N;4EJI;1EHE;1EHE;3P6W;3ZG2;4J6C;4J6C;2VN0;3L62;2JJO;4CK8;1P2Y;3PSX;3P6T;4COH;2X5W;3TNK;4XRY;4L4G;2D09;3KX4;4G3R;3UAS;4L0F;2RFB;4J6D;4J6D;4XRZ;4FIA;4TVF;2Q9F;2A1M;2L8M;4C27;4BMM;2J0D;3B98;1W0G;2IJ7;2J4S;4L4E;4JBT;4JBT;4EP6;3ZPI;1Q5D;1NR6;3ABB;3ABB;2A1O;2D0E;4EGP;4EK1;4HGI;3P6P;4TPN;1GEB;5CP4;2WIY;4H6O;3CXV;1Z8Q;1Z8Q;4KPA;3JUS;4I91;3CV8;3TIK;3CPP;4MM0;3JUV;3R9B;3R9B;1H5Z;4G7G;1E9X;4ENH;4EGM;2Z36;2HI4;3E4E;1DZ4;2BMH;2Y46;2Y46;4OQS;4OQS;1YQP;1RF9;3OFT;2Y98;2Y98;3O1A;3ZK5;2WIV;3N9Y;3P3Z;3G1Q;4IQ9;4KF2;2C6H;4HGF;4K0F;3P6R;3RUK;4EGN;1P7R;1YRC;3LC4;3MDM;3MDR;4KTF;3AWQ;2RCL;4DUC;8CPP;3MGX;3TMZ;1PHE;4DUA;1T93;4GL7;3EBS;4FMX;4K9T;4DTZ;3KHM;1IWI;3FWJ;2H7R;2WUZ;3DSI;1O76;3TDA;2Z97;3KX5;1P0W;3S79;3TKT;4G45;2CI0;3E5L;1LWL;1ULW;1ULW;4I3Q;4IPS;4G44;3A4Z;1GEM;4G47;4G1X;2ZBX;1JME;4E2P;1GED;1GED;3WRJ;2Z3U;4DXY;1GEI;1GEI;1PO5;4MGJ;4FDH;1PHB;4H24;2Z3T;3TK3;4UAX;6CPP;3KSW;3BEN;3NC7;4NKY;3P6Q;3G5N;2PG5;1TQN;4LHT;4FYZ;3MVR;2W0B;2BVJ;1JIP;1S1F;3OL5;4JX1;2ZAX;2IJ4;4L40;2NNJ;1R9O;4WNV;4EJH;2QBL;3GPH;4L36;2YGX;2YGX;1GEJ;1GEJ;3EJB;3R1B;3ZG3;3IBD;2A1N;2QBM;3ZBY;2IJ3;4L4D;4WPD;1FAG;2YOO;2RCM;3N9Z;3DGI;2NNI;3TZO;3W9C;3A1L;3A4G;2ZBZ;1K2O;4NY4;3R9C;3R9C;3WVS;4TX3;1DZ9;3VM4;3WSP;3M4V;2WHF;4FXB;3EJD;1BU7;4Z5Q;3RWL;1P0X;3CP4;4TUV;3OO3;2NNH;1C8J;1ZOA;2VZ7;4Y8W;1JFC;1JFC;3BE0;1CPT;1UE8;2FE6;4UBS;1JIO;3V8D;1F25;1F25;4L4C;2BDM;3CY1;3K1O;3DAX;2JJP;2FDY;4I4H;2ZWT;4ICT;3AWP;4UYL;4J6B;4J6B;3IW1;4HGG;3NXU;2ZUH;4NKX;4WMZ;4K9V;1Z11;4TT5;3E6I;1N4G;2FER;4NKZ;4UVR;1F24;1F24;1IO7;2XN8;4HGH;3EL3;1T86;1J51;3DSK;4UQH;3NV5;2X2N;3A51;4KPB;3EJE;3K9Y;3FWG;4O4P;2Y5Z;2Y5Z;1IO9;2Q9G;2ZUI;4G48;3WRH;4GQS;4L77;1PHD;4K9X;4APY;4L0E;1ZO4;3NC6;3TJS;3A4H;1OXA;3CY0;3P3X;2ZWU;2ZUJ;2WX2;3G5H;3IW0;3CLI;4RUI;2NZA;3NPL;1Z8P;3DAM;1T2B;1JPZ;1ROM;1ROM;4DTY;3B6H;4RM4;3QU8;4K9U;3VTJ;2CIB;7CPP;4NZ2;4KKY;3NA0;4GGV;2VKU;2UWH;3OFU;3BDZ;2VE4;2WGY;4DU2;3T3Z;4TPO;3ZSN;3ZSN;3P99;4IQ7;3EKB;4RQL;1GWI;1GWI;1UYU;1W0E;1DT6;1CL6;1CL6;4FB2;1LFK;3LXI;3AWM;2WIO;3OIA;2PG7;2Q6N;2IJ2;4C28;2VE3;4KEW;2ROM;2ROM;4KQ8;3WRM;3B99;3L4D;4DUF;4LXJ;4C9P;3S7S;3CXY;4R20;1XQD;1XQD;2UUQ;4AW3;4AW3;4AW3;1T85;3QM4;3K9V;2VZM;4L6G;4DTW;3TBG;3KOH;4KEY;3EQM;1EUP;1T88;1BVY;1EHG;1EHG;2ZQX;4L49;3UA1;5CPP;2GQX;1IWK;3CXX;3WRI;3L61;4JLT;1W0F;3C6G;2CD8;2Y5N;2Y5N;3ABA;4DNZ;2YJN;4OQR;4OQR;4I4G;4B7S;4KTL;2LQD;1SMJ;3P6N;2RCH;1SMI;3CZH;2RFC;2XFH;3UA5;4UMZ;3P6M;2H7S;4CPP;1YQO;4WPZ;1EHF;1EHF;3NC5;2ZAW;4DUD;3IVY;3DBM;4HGJ;3P6X;4H23;1F4U;2V0M;2W0A;2WHW;4C9O;4WNU;2ZBY;3P6S;2WM4;2WM4;1IZO;1Z8O;6CP4;4EGO;4C9K;3G93;1CMN;1CMN;3ZKP;3LXH;4Z5P;4Z5P;2ZQJ;2C7X;2FEU;1N40;1LGF;3CBD;3E5J;3EKD;3KW4;2QBO;3EKF;3VOO;4C9L;4L4B;4EJJ;3TYW;2IJ5;4K9W;1SE6;1FAH;2UVN;3G5F;3NV6;3P6O;3QZ1;2JJN;3VNO;1EA1;1Q5E;4L4A;4PWV;1X8V;4L4F;3P6U;3DSJ;2WV2;1P0V;4NKV;3NC3;4DUE;3T3R;3LD6;3MDV;3HF2;4C9M;4DO1;2XBK;2WM5;2WM5;4IPW;2FR7;2PG6;3DL9;2P85;3ME6;1N6B;3WEC;1DZ8;1PKF;2X7Y;4G46;4TRI;1DZ6;3T3Q;4L54;1GEK;4H1N;3T3S;2XC3;3QOA;4JWS;1PQ2;4WG2;3DBG;2FDW;3IW2;1JIN;4R21;3SWZ;3MDT;3FWI;1UED;4KF0;4DVQ;3P6V;3WRK;3E5K;1JFB;1JFB;3FWF;2QBN;2X9P;3KX3;4RRT;1SUO;4G2G;3P3O;3BUJ;4KTJ;3DAN;2H7Q;1PHC;4WNT;2WI9;4G3J;2J1M;1PHG;3QI8;4WQJ;1T87;1ZO9;4EJG;2W09;1IO8;4R1Z;1QMQ;1CP4;4WQJ;1RE9;1RE9;4GL5;3L63;1IO8;4BY0;3MZS;3A50;2YCA;2YCA;2NNB;4DNJ;3NA1;3L63;1CP4;2W09;4EJG;1QMQ;2HPD;4R1Z;1Z10;1GJM;5DE9;4D75;4D78;4D7D;4D6Z;4ZGX;4WQ0	0.9147871926	433	-87.9	-25.4708780064

zf-C2H2	PF00096.25	1	159	The C2H2 zinc finger is the classical zinc finger domain. The two conserved cysteines and histidines co-ordinate a zinc ion. The following pattern describes the zinc finger. #-X-C-X(1-5)-C-X3-#-X5-#-X2-H-X(3-6)-[H/C] Where X can be any amino acid, and numbers in brackets indicate the number of residues. The positions marked # are those that are important for the stable fold of the zinc finger. The final position can be either his or cys. The C2H2 zinc finger is composed of two short beta strands followed by an alpha helix. The amino terminal part of the helix binds the major groove in DNA binding zinc fingers. The accepted consensus binding sequence for Sp1 is usually defined by the asymmetric hexanucleotide core GGGCGG but this sequence does not include, among others, the GAG (=CTC) repeat that constitutes a high-affinity site for Sp1 binding to the wt1 promoter [2].	zf-C2H2	Domain	85153	23.1	49	13.32	Changed	Zinc finger, C2H2 type	1ZNF;2WBU;2WBU;2WBU;2EMM;2YTA;2M0D;2EMH;2EOF;2YRJ;2YU5;2EOX;2EQ1;4M9E;4M9E;4M9E;2EM6;2EMF;2EMG;2YTN;2EN1;2ENE;4R2S;4R2S;1F2I;2EM1;2EN4;2EN9;2EOE;1BBO;1BBO;2EOJ;2EPU;1ARE;2EOP;4F2J;2YT9;2EML;2LVT;2YTH;1A1K;2EPT;1ARD;2YTO;1PAA;2EM3;2RV6;2EP1;7ZNF;2EON;2M0E;4R2R;4R2R;2EN7;2ELQ;2EOK;2EM2;2EOG;2EMY;4GZN;2ENA;2M0F;1A1L;2EOL;2LCE;2RV2;2YSV;1ARF;2EP3;1AAY;2EOW;1A1I;2ADR;2ADR;2EMI;2EMZ;2EQ2;2WBS;2WBS;2WBS;2EP2;2EQ0;1A1H;4R2P;4R2P;2YU8;2JPA;2JPA;2ELY;2YTR;3UK3;1JK2;2GLI;2GLI;1A1J;2YTS;2EOR;1VA2;4IS1;2YTF;2I13;2EL5;2YTP;2EMJ;2YTI;4R2E;4R2E;2YTQ;1RIK;4R2Q;4R2Q;2MA7;2YTG;1X6E;2YRH;4M9V;2DLK;2RSJ;2YTK;2EMC;1SP1;1U86;1UBD;2ENF;1A1G;2ELS;2YTB;4ZNF;2EMV;2YTJ;4R2A;2EQ3;1VA3;1XF7;2LVU;2KMK;2KMK;3W5K;2N26;2JP9;2JP9;2EMK;2EOZ;1SP2;2EMW;1P47;1A1F;1U85;2EBT;2EBT;2EPY;2EMA;1ZAA;1P7A;3ZNF;2EQW;4X9J;2PRT;2PRT;2EME;4R2C;2RPC;2RUT;4R2C;2RUT;1RIM;5A7U	0.4625363305	23	0.1	0.4329004329
PPR_2	PF13041.5	1	226	This repeat has no known function. It is about 35 amino acids long and is found in up to 18 copies in some proteins. The family appears to be greatly expanded in plants and fungi. The repeat has been called PPR [1].

RRM_1	PF00076.21	1	72	The RRM motif is probably diagnostic of an RNA binding protein. RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including various hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snRNPs. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases The C-terminal beta strand (4th strand) and final helix are hard to align and have been omitted in the SEED alignment The LA proteins (Swiss:P05455) have an N terminal rrm which is included in the seed. There is a second region towards the C terminus that has some features characteristic of a rrm but does not appear to have the important structural core of a rrm. The LA proteins (Swiss:P05455) are one of the main autoantigens in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease.	RRM_1	Domain	99972	67.4	23	23.15	Changed	RNA recognition motif. (a.k.a.

ABC_tran	PF00005.26	1	55	ABC transporters for a large family of proteins responsible for translocation of a variety of compounds across biological membranes. ABC transporters are the largest family of proteins in many completely sequenced bacteria. ABC transporters are composed of two copies of this domain and two copies of a transmembrane domain Pfam:PF00664. These four domains may belong to a single polypeptide as in Swiss:P13569, or belong in different polypeptide chains.

NDUFB11	PF17250.1	0	9	Complex I of the respiratory chain is a proton-pumping, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase that oxidises NADH in the electron transport pathway. Plants contain the series of 14 highly conserved complex I subunits found in other eukaryotic and related prokaryotic enzymes [1].													
DUF5323	PF17257.1	0	17	This family of proteins found in Eukaryota, has no known function.													
DUF3458_C	PF17432.1	0	233	This presumed domain is functionally uncharacterised. This domain is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.													
Corazonin	PF17308.1	0	9	This domain family is found in Corazonin proteins in Drosophila and other Anthropods. Corazonin (Crz)is a neuropeptide with a wide spectrum of biological functions in diverse insect groups. It was first discovered due to its myostimulatory activities on the heart muscle of Periplaneta Americana and the hyper-neural muscle of Carausius morosus [1]. In Drosophila melanogaster, Crz plays diverse roles ranging from a regulator of insulin producing cells in the brain to roles specific to tissues, life stages, and gender [2].													
Bee_toxin	PF17454.1	0	3	Bee venom contains a variety of peptides such as melittin, apamin, adolapin and mast cell degranulating peptide [1]. Bee venom has been used in the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Epilepsy, Multiple Sclerosis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [2]. Secondary structure analysis of apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide, tertiapin and secapin have been studied. The predicted structure for mast cell degranulating peptide is almost spherical with the eight positive centres evenly distributed over the surface. It has also been suggested that these four peptides share a common folding pattern, which is centred on a beta-turn covalently linked to an alpha-helical segment by two disulphide links. It is further suggested that apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide and tertiapin form a single molecular class [3]. This domain family is found in apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide and tertiapin. Apamin, the most widely studied member of this family has been shown to be a selective blocker of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa2.X or SK) channels [1].													
Secapin	PF17521.1	0	2	Family members are bee venom peptides such as Secapin. Mature secapin is composed of 25 amino acid residues that contain a disulfide link [1]. Secapin has been demonstrated to act as a potent neurotoxin. In Apis mellifera secapin exhibits anti-bacterial activity and induces inflammation and pain with anti-fibrinolytic, anti-elastolytic, and anti-microbial activities [2]. Secapin shares a common folding pattern with apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide and tertiapin; it is centred on a beta-turn covalently linked to an alpha-helical segment by one disulphide link (two disulphide links in the other peptides) [3].
