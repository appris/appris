Bio::WebAgent \- A base class for Web (any protocol) access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 3
\&  # This is a abstract superclass for bioperl modules accessing web
\&  # resources \- normally you do not instantiate it but one of its
\&  # subclasess.
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This abstract superclass is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent which
allows protocol independent access of remote locations over
the Net.
.PP
It takes care of error handling, proxies and various net protocols.
BioPerl classes accessing the net should inherit from it.  For details,
see LWP::UserAgent.
.PP
The interface is still evolving. For now, two public methods have been
copied from Bio::DB::WebDBSeqI: \fBdelay()\fR and delay_policy. These are
used to prevent overwhelming the server by rapidly repeated . Ideally
there should be a common abstract superclass with these. See delay.

\& Args    : string

.SS "delay"
.IX Subsection "delay"
.Vb 5
\& Title   : delay
\& Usage   : $secs = $self\->delay([$secs])
\& Function: get/set number of seconds to delay between fetches
\& Returns : number of seconds to delay
\& Args    : new value
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 the default is to use the value specified by \fBdelay_policy()\fR.
This can be overridden by calling this method, or by passing the
\&\-delay argument to \fBnew()\fR.
.SS "delay_policy"
.IX Subsection "delay_policy"
.Vb 5
\& Title   : delay_policy
\& Usage   : $secs = $self\->delay_policy
\& Function: return number of seconds to delay between calls to remote db
\& Returns : number of seconds to delay
\& Args    : none
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 The default delay policy is 3s.  Override in subclasses to
implement other delays.  The timer has only second resolution, so the delay
will actually be +/\- 1s.
.SS "sleep"
.IX Subsection "sleep"
.Vb 5
\& Title   : sleep
\& Usage   : $self\->sleep
\& Function: sleep for a number of seconds indicated by the delay policy
\& Returns : none
\& Args    : none
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This method keeps track of the last time it was called and only
imposes a sleep if it was called more recently than the \fBdelay_policy()\fR
allows.
