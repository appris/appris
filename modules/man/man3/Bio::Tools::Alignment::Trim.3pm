.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a specialized module designed by Chad for Chad to trim sequences
based on a highly specialized list of requirements. In other words, write
something that will trim sequences 'just like the people in the lab would
do manually'.
.PP
I settled on a sliding-window-average style of search which is ugly and
slow but does _exactly_ what I want it to do.
.PP
Mental note: rewrite this.

It is very important to keep in mind the context in which this module was
written: strictly to support the projects for which Consed.pm was
designed.
