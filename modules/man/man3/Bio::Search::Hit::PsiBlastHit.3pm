.SH "NAME"
Bio::Search::Hit::PsiBlastHit \- Bioperl BLAST Hit object
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
See Bio::Search::Result::BlastResult.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Bio::Search::Hit::PsiBlastHit.pm module encapsulates data and
methods for manipulating \*(L"hits\*(R" from a \s-1BLAST\s0 report. A \s-1BLAST\s0 hit is a
collection of HSPs along with other metadata such as sequence name and
score information. Hit objects are accessed via
Bio::Search::Result::BlastResult objects after parsing a \s-1BLAST\s0
report using the Bio::SearchIO system.
.PP
In Blast lingo, the \*(L"sbjct\*(R" sequences are all the sequences in a
target database which were compared against a \*(L"query\*(R" sequence.  The
terms \*(L"sbjct\*(R" and \*(L"hit\*(R" will be used interchangeably in this module.
All methods that take 'sbjct' as an argument also support 'hit' as a
synonym.
.PP
This module supports \s-1BLAST\s0 versions 1.x and 2.x, gapped and ungapped,
and PSI-BLAST.
.PP
The construction of PsiBlastHit objects is performed by
Bio::SearchIO::blast::PsiBlastHitFactory in a process that is
orchestrated by the Blast parser (Bio::SearchIO::blast).
The resulting PsiBlastHits are then accessed via
Bio::Search::Result::BlastResult). Therefore, you do not need to
use Bio::Search::Hit::PsiBlastHit) directly. If you need to
construct PsiBlastHits directly, see the \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR function for details.
.PP
For Bio::SearchIO \s-1BLAST\s0 parsing usage examples, see the
\&\f(CW\*(C`examples/search\-blast\*(C'\fR directory of the Bioperl distribution.
.SS "\s-1HSP\s0 Tiling and Ambiguous Alignments"
.IX Subsection "HSP Tiling and Ambiguous Alignments"
If a Blast hit has more than one \s-1HSP,\s0 the Bio::Search::Hit::PsiBlastHit.pm
object has the ability to merge overlapping HSPs into contiguous
blocks. This permits the PsiBlastHit object to sum data across all HSPs
without counting data in the overlapping regions multiple times, which
would happen if data from each overlapping \s-1HSP\s0 are simply summed.  \s-1HSP\s0
tiling is performed automatically when methods of the PsiBlastHit object
that rely on tiled data are invoked. These include
\&\fBfrac_identical()\fR, \fBfrac_conserved()\fR, \fBgaps()\fR,
\&\fBfrac_aligned_query()\fR, \fBfrac_aligned_hit()\fR,
\&\fBnum_unaligned_query()\fR, \fBnum_unaligned_hit()\fR.
.PP
It also permits the assessment of an \*(L"ambiguous alignment\*(R" if the
query (or sbjct) sequences from different HSPs overlap
(see \fBambiguous_aln()\fR). The existence
of an overlap could indicate a biologically interesting region in the
sequence, such as a repeated domain.  The PsiBlastHit object uses the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-OVERLAP\*(C'\fR parameter to determine when two sequences overlap; if this is
set to 2 \*(-- the default \*(-- then any two sbjct or query \s-1HSP\s0 sequences
must overlap by more than two residues to get merged into the same
contig and counted as an overlap. See the \s-1BUGS\s0  section below for
\&\*(L"issues\*(R" with \s-1HSP\s0 tiling.
.PP
The results of the \s-1HSP\s0 tiling is reported with the following ambiguity codes:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   \*(Aqq\*(Aq = Query sequence contains multiple sub\-sequences matching
\&         a single region in the sbjct sequence.
\&
\&   \*(Aqs\*(Aq = Subject (PsiBlastHit) sequence contains multiple sub\-sequences matching
\&         a single region in the query sequence.
\&
\&   \*(Aqqs\*(Aq = Both query and sbjct sequences contain more than one
\&          sub\-sequence with similarity to the other sequence.
.Ve
.PP

.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "DEPENDENCIES"
Bio::Search::Hit::PsiBlastHit.pm is a concrete class that inherits from
Bio::Root::Root and Bio::Search::Hit::HitI.  and relies on
Bio::Search::HSP::BlastHSP.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
One consequence of the \s-1HSP\s0 tiling is that methods that rely on \s-1HSP\s0
tiling such as \fBfrac_identical()\fR, \fBfrac_conserved()\fR, \fBgaps()\fR
etc. may report misleading numbers when \f(CW\*(C`\-OVERLAP\*(C'\fR is set to a large
number.  For example, say we have two HSPs and the query sequence tile
as follows:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&            1      8             22      30        40             60
\& Full seq:  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&                    *  ** *   **
\& HSP1:             \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-                    (6 identical matches)
\&                              **   **  **
\& HSP2:                        \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           (6 identical matches)
.Ve
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`\-OVERLAP\*(C'\fR is set to some number over 4, \s-1HSP1\s0 and \s-1HSP2\s0 will not be
tiled into a single contig and their numbers of identical matches will
be added, giving a total of 12, not 10 if they had be combined into
one contig. This can lead to number greater than 1.0 for methods
\&\fBfrac_identical()\fR and \fBfrac_conserved()\fR. This is less of an issue
with gapped Blast since it tends to combine HSPs that would be listed
separately without gapping.  (Fractions >1.0 can be viewed as a
signal for an interesting alignment that warrants further inspection,
thus turning this bug into a feature :\-).
.PP
Using large values for \f(CW\*(C`\-OVERLAP\*(C'\fR can lead to incorrect numbers
reported by methods that rely on \s-1HSP\s0 tiling but can be useful if you
care more about detecting ambiguous alignments.  Setting \f(CW\*(C`\-OVERLAP\*(C'\fR
to zero will lead to the most accurate numbers for the
tiling-dependent methods but will be useless for detecting overlapping
HSPs since all HSPs will appear to overlap.

Information about the various data members of this module is provided for those
wishing to modify or understand the code. Two things to bear in mind:
.IP "1 Do \s-1NOT\s0 rely on these in any code outside of this module." 4
.IX Item "1 Do NOT rely on these in any code outside of this module."
All data members are prefixed with an underscore to signify that they are private.
Always use accessor methods. If the accessor doesn't exist or is inadequate,
create or modify an accessor (and let me know, too!). (An exception to this might
be for BlastHSP.pm which is more tightly coupled to PsiBlastHit.pm and
may access PsiBlastHit data members directly for efficiency purposes, but probably
should not).
.IP "2 This documentation may be incomplete and out of date." 4
.IX Item "2 This documentation may be incomplete and out of date."
It is easy for these data member descriptions to become obsolete as
this module is still evolving. Always double check this info and search
for members not described here.
