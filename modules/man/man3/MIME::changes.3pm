Well, it seems 3.01_01 failed tests on Win32 due to me accidentally
changing the line ending format to DOSish. Also the way that email
extraction for \s-1SMTP\s0 with or without Mail::Address was different (from
2.117 even).  So ive fixed that.
.Sp
Anybody depending on the undocumented \fBextract_addrs()\fR is in for a suprise.
I suggest you look at using Mail::Address.

(This version is a test release, if its ok then I'll re-release it as

.Sp
Patched the pod to use correct entities Thanks to Ed Avis  for the patch.
Added better support for funky names in the from field when sending via \s-1SMTP,\s0 thanks to
prodding by Darren Hemphill and Ollie Gallardo. (Actually I kind of messed this up orginally
and no doubt Darren wasn't impressed. I ended up using something pretty close to his solution.
My bad for not paying more attention. Sorry mate.)
.Sp
08/21: Apparently I never uploaded my changes for this version to \s-1CPAN.\s0 Sigh.
.Sp
*** Win32 \s-1CHANGES\s0 ***
.Sp
Up until this release the default \fBsend()\fR method for all \s-1OS\s0'es has been to invoke sendmail
and pipe the mail to it. This behaviour has now changed on Win32 to default to using \s-1SMTP.\s0
This means that if your /site/lib/Net/libnet.cfg file is properly configured then you can
use \s-1SMTP\s0 without specifying a send method explicitly.  This seemed a rational decision as
most Win32 users who send mails are using an \s-1SMTP\s0 server and not a tool like sendmail.
.Sp
*** \s-1SMTP CHANGES\s0 ***
.Sp
Jonathan Eunice <jeunice at illuminata dot com> pointed out an interesting bug in the
interaction between MIME::Lite and Net::SMTP/Net::CMD.  This was that sending a mail
ending in \*(L"\en\en\*(R" without additional encoding would cause Net::CMD to send an incorrect
end of mail signal to the \s-1SMTP\s0 server which would result in A) The mail failing to be sent due
to a timeout, and B) MIME::Lite to report that all was well.
.Sp
This has been fixed by checking to make sure that if the last character sent was \en, but the
last two chars were not \er\en then the \en is turned into an \er, which Net::CMD then adds an \en
to and then sends the normal \*(L".\er\en\*(R" to terminate the message.  Weird error, that im not
entirely sure has been resolved properly. Please inform me if this screws anything up that it
shouldn't.
.Sp
As stated earlier send_by_smtp wasnt extracting the _real_ email address from the overall fancy
once specified in the From: field. This is resolved now, fancy display names are now possible
while using \s-1SMTP.\s0
.Sp
*** Content-Id ***
.Sp
It was pointed out by alex via \s-1CPAN RT\s0 that Content-Id needs to have angle brackets around
it or \s-1HTML\s0 mails dont show up properly in many mail clients, furthermore the \s-1RFC\s0 mandates it
(to be honest im taking his word on this, please feel free to yell at me if this causes trouble),
so as he suggested I am automatically adding them in they arent provided.
.Sp
*** sendmail path ***
.Sp
Dom pointed out via \s-1CPAN RT\s0 that despite some effort going in to trying to discover the correct
location of sendmail, that it was still using a bad default. Fixed.
.Sp
*** Date Stamping ***
.Sp
Kurt reported via \s-1RT\s0 that datestamps were not being correctly formatted. His patch has been incorporated
with only one change, a comment where Perl was spelled \s-1PERL :\-\s0)
.Sp
*** Quoted printable fix ***
.Sp
Klaus Rusch noted a bug in how quoted-printable handled weird \er\en combinations. Fixed now.

Eryq has disappeared. His web site remains but he doesnt answer emails.
.Sp
I have taken it onto myself to take over maintenance until he returns to
reclaim his excellent work.
.Sp
I don't intend to develop this in an serious way. I'll patch it if people
have a patch and generally keep it ticking over, but dont expect new features.
.Sp
This release has code that actually works with MIME::Lite now. As well as a few
other minor additions (like a test for this functionailty)
.Sp
For stuff that could be done, a first place would be to rewrite and extend the
test suite. It should use Test::More or Test::Builder at the very least.
.Sp
I also might rip out the preformatted doc pages. It makes the distro way fatter
than it needs to be. I reckon the package contains the \s-1POD\s0 in at least three forms.
A wee tad overkill I think. :\-)

.IP "Version 2.114   (2001/08/16)" 4
.IX Item "Version 2.114 (2001/08/16)"
New special '\s-1AUTO\s0' content type in \fBnew()\fR/\fBbuild()\fR tells MIME::Lite to
try and guess the type from file extension.  To make use of
this, you'll want to install \fBMIME::Types\fR.
The \*(L"\s-1AUTO\*(R"\s0 setting can be made the default default (instead of \*(L"\s-1TEXT\*(R"\s0)
if you set \f(CW\*(C`$AUTO_CONTENT_TYPE = 1, $PARANOID = 0\*(C'\fR.

\&\s-1SMTP\s0 failures (in send_by_smtp) now add the \f(CW$smtp\fR\->message to the

\&\fIThanks to Thomas R. Wyant \s-1III\s0 for the patch.\fR
.Sp
Made a subtle change to \f(CW\*(C`as_string\*(C'\fR which supposedly fixes a
failed \s-1MIME\s0 data.t test with Perl 5.004_04 on \s-1NT 4\s0 sp6.
The problem might only exist in this old perl, but as the patch
author says, not everyone has climbed higher on the Perl ladder.

.IX Item "Version 2.101 (2000/06/06)"
Major revision to \fBprint_body()\fR and \fBbody_as_string()\fR so that
\&\*(L"body\*(R" really means \*(L"the part after the header\*(R", which is what most
people would want in this context.  This is \fBnot\fR how it was used
1.x, where \*(L"body\*(R" only meant \*(L"the body of a simple singlepart\*(R".
Hopefully, this change will solve many problems and create very few ones.
.Sp
Added support for attaching a part to a \*(L"message/rfc822\*(R", treating
the \*(L"message\*(R" type as a multipart-like container.
.Sp
Now takes care not to include \*(L"Bcc:\*(R" in header when using send_by_smtp,
