.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
PrimarySeq is a lightweight sequence object, storing the sequence, its
name, a computer-useful unique name, and other fundamental attributes.
It does not contain sequence features or other information.  To have a
sequence with sequence features you should use the Seq object which uses
this object.
.PP
Although new users will use Bio::PrimarySeq a lot, in general you will
be using it from the Bio::Seq object. For more information on Bio::Seq
see Bio::Seq. For interest you might like to know that
Bio::Seq has-a Bio::PrimarySeq and forwards most of the function calls
to do with sequence to it (the has-a relationship lets us get out of a
otherwise nasty cyclical reference in Perl which would leak memory).
.PP
Sequence objects are defined by the Bio::PrimarySeqI interface, and this
object is a pure Perl implementation of the interface. If that's
gibberish to you, don't worry. The take home message is that this
object is the bioperl default sequence object, but other people can
use their own objects as sequences if they so wish. If you are
interested in wrapping your own objects as compliant Bioperl sequence
objects, then you should read the Bio::PrimarySeqI documentation
.PP
The documentation of this object is a merge of the Bio::PrimarySeq and
Bio::PrimarySeqI documentation.  This allows all the methods which you can
call on sequence objects here.

\& Function: Get or set  the sequence as a string of letters. The case of

\&           upper case for proteins and lower case for DNA sequence (IUPAC

\&           \*(Aq*\*(Aq,\*(Aq?\*(Aq,\*(Aq=\*(Aq and \*(Aq~\*(Aq. Spaces are not valid. Note that this

.SS "length"
.IX Subsection "length"
.Vb 4
\& Title   : length
\& Usage   : $len = $seqobj\->length();
\& Function: Get the stored length of the sequence in number of symbols (bases
\&           or amino acids). In some circumstances, you can also set this attribute:
\&
\&           1. For empty sequences, you can set the length to anything you want:
\&              my $seqobj = Bio::PrimarySeq\->new( \-length => 123 );
\&              my $len = $seqobj\->len; # 123
\&           2. To save memory when using very long sequences, you can set the
\&              length of the sequence to the length of the sequence (and nothing
\&              else):
\&              my $seqobj = Bio::PrimarySeq\->new( \-seq => \*(AqACGT...\*(Aq ); # 1 Mbp sequence
\&              # process $seqobj... then after you\*(Aqre done with it

\&
\&           Note that if you set seq() to a value other than undef at any time,
\&           the length attribute will be reset.

.Ve
.SS "display_id"
.IX Subsection "display_id"
.Vb 3
\& Title   : display_id or display_name
\& Usage   : $id_string = $seqobj\->display_id();
\& Function: Get or set the display id, aka the common name of the sequence object.
\&
\&           The semantics of this is that it is the most likely string to
\&           be used as an identifier of the sequence, and likely to have
\&           "human" readability.  The id is equivalent to the ID field of
\&           the GenBank/EMBL databanks and the id field of the
\&           Swissprot/sptrembl database. In fasta format, the >(\eS+) is
\&           presumed to be the id, though some people overload the id to
\&           embed other information. Bioperl does not use any embedded
\&           information in the ID field, and people are encouraged to use
\&           other mechanisms (accession field for example, or extending
\&           the sequence object) to solve this.
\&
\&           With the new Bio::DescribeableI interface, display_name aliases
\&           to this method.
\& Returns : A string for the display ID
\& Args    : Optional string for the display ID to set
.Ve
.SS "accession_number"
.IX Subsection "accession_number"
.Vb 8
\& Title   : accession_number or object_id
\& Usage   : $unique_key = $seqobj\->accession_number;
\& Function: Returns the unique biological id for a sequence, commonly
\&           called the accession_number. For sequences from established
\&           databases, the implementors should try to use the correct
\&           accession number. Notice that primary_id() provides the
\&           unique id for the implementation, allowing multiple objects
\&           to have the same accession number in a particular implementation.
\&
\&           For sequences with no accession number, this method should
\&           return "unknown".
\&
\&           [Note this method name is likely to change in 1.3]
\&
\&           With the new Bio::IdentifiableI interface, this is aliased

\& Title   : primary_id
\& Usage   : $unique_key = $seqobj\->primary_id;
\& Function: Returns the unique id for this object in this

\&           own object ids in a way the implementation can control
\&           clients can expect one id to map to one object.
\&
\&           For sequences with no natural primary id, this method
\&           should return a stringified memory location.

\&
\&           This is not called <type> because this would cause

\& Title   : _guess_alphabet
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Automatically guess and set the type of sequence: dna, rna, protein
\&           or \*(Aq\*(Aq if the sequence was empty. This method first removes dots (.),
\&           dashes (\-) and question marks (?) before guessing the alphabet
\&           using the IUPAC conventions for ambiguous residues. Since the DNA and
\&           RNA characters are also valid characters for proteins, there is
\&           no foolproof way of determining the right alphabet. This is our best
\&           guess only!
\& Returns : string \*(Aqdna\*(Aq, \*(Aqrna\*(Aq, \*(Aqprotein\*(Aq or \*(Aq\*(Aq.
\& Args    : none
