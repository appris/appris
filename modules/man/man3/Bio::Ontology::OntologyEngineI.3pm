Bio::Ontology::OntologyEngineI \- Interface a minimal Ontology implementation should satisfy
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    # see documentation of methods
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This describes the minimal interface an ontology query engine should
provide.  It intentionally does not make explicit references to the
ontology being a \s-1DAG,\s0 nor does it mandate that the ontology be a
vocabulary. Rather, it tries to generically express what should be
accessible (queriable) about an ontology.
.PP
The idea is to allow for different implementations for different
purposes, which may then differ as to which operations are efficient
and which are not, and how much richer the functionality is on top of
this minimalistic set of methods. Check modules in the Bio::Ontology
namespace to find out which implementations exist. At the time of
writing, there is a SimpleOntologyEngine (which does not use
Graph.pm), and a Graph.pm\-based implementation in SimpleGOEngine.
.PP
Ontology parsers in Bio::OntologyIO are required to return an
implementation of this interface.

\& Title   : get_all_terms
\& Usage   : get_all_terms: TermI

\&
\&           This is more a decorator method. We provide a default
\&           implementation here that loops over all root terms and gets
\&           all descendants for each root term. The overall union of
\&           terms is then made unique by name and ontology.
\&
\&           We do not mandate an order here in which the terms are
\&           returned. In fact, the default implementation will return
\&           them in unpredictable order.
\&
\&           Engine implementations that can provide a more efficient
\&           method for obtaining all terms should definitely override
\&           this.

\& Function: Find term instances matching queries for their attributes.
\&
\&           An implementation may not support querying for arbitrary
\&           attributes, but can generally be expected to accept
\&           \-identifier and \-name as queries. If both are provided,
\&           they are implicitly intersected.
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : an array of zero or more Bio::Ontology::TermI objects
\& Args    : Named parameters. The following parameters should be recognized
\&           by any implementation:

\&              \-identifier    query by the given identifier

\& Ontologies are a very new domain in bioperl, and we are not sure yet
\& what we will want to do on and with ontologies in which
\& situation. The methods from here on downwards are solely API
\& descriptions to solicit comment and feedback; the chance of any of

\&
\& Disclaimer: As long as an API method stays in this section, it is
\& subject to change, possibly even radical change or complete
\& deletion. If it\*(Aqs not implemented yet (most likely it isn\*(Aqt),
\& implement yourself at your own risk.
\&
\& So far for the disclaimer. The reason the API description is here,
\& however, is to solicit feedback. Please feel encouraged to share your
\& opinion, regardless of what it is (a notable difference of this API
\& method to others is that there is actually no working code behind it

\& Title   : common_ancestor_path
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Get the paths from two terms A and B to term C, such that
\&           there is no other term D to which A and B would have a shorter
\&           path, provided there is a term C to which both A and B are
\&           connected by a path.
\&
\&           Note that the path to the common ancestor between A and A
\&           exists, has distance zero, and predicate "identity".
\&
\&           The search for the common ancestor C can be further
\&           constrained by supplying a predicate term. If supplied, the
\&           predicates of the two paths (A,C) and (B,C) must have a
\&           common ancestor identical to the predicate, or that has a
\&           path to the predicate.
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : The path of the first term to the common ancestor in scalar
\&           context, and both paths in list context. Paths are
\&           Bio::Ontology::PathI compliant objects.
\& Args    : The two terms (Bio::Ontology::TermI objects), and optionally
\&           a constraining common predicate (Bio::Ontology::TermI object).
\&           The latter may also be given as a scalar, in which case it
\&           is treated as a boolean that, if TRUE, means that the two paths
\&           must have identical predicates in order to be returned.
