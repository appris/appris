\& Notes   : When you create a sub_trace_object, the peak indices
\&     will still be pointing to the apporpriate location _in the

.SS "\fBdisplay_id()\fP"
.IX Subsection "display_id()"
.Vb 10
\& Title   : display_id()
\& Usage   : $id_string = $obj\->display_id();
\& Function: Returns the display id, aka the common name of the Quality
\&        object.
\&        The semantics of this is that it is the most likely string to be
\&        used as an identifier of the quality sequence, and likely to have
\&        "human" readability.  The id is equivalent to the ID field of the
\&        GenBank/EMBL databanks and the id field of the Swissprot/sptrembl
\&        database. In fasta format, the >(\eS+) is presumed to be the id,
\&        though some people overload the id to embed other information.
\&        Bioperl does not use any embedded information in the ID field,
\&        and people are encouraged to use other mechanisms (accession
\&        field for example, or extending the sequence object) to solve
\&        this. Notice that $seq\->id() maps to this function, mainly for
\&        legacy/convience issues.
\&        This method sets the display_id for the Quality object.
\& Returns : A string
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new display_id for
\&        the Quality object.
\& Status  : Virtual

.SS "\fBaccession_number()\fP"
.IX Subsection "accession_number()"
.Vb 10
\& Title   : accession_number()
\& Usage   : $unique_biological_key = $obj\->accession_number();
\& Function: Returns the unique biological id for a sequence, commonly
\&        called the accession_number. For sequences from established
\&        databases, the implementors should try to use the correct
\&        accession number. Notice that primary_id() provides the unique id
\&        for the implementation, allowing multiple objects to have the same
\&        accession number in a particular implementation. For sequences
\&        with no accession number, this method should return "unknown".
\&        This method sets the accession_number for the Quality
\&        object. 
\& Returns : A string (the value of accession_number)
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new accession_number
\&        for the Quality object.
\& Status  : Virtual

\& Title   : primary_id()
\& Usage   : $unique_implementation_key = $obj\->primary_id();
\& Function: Returns the unique id for this object in this implementation.
\&        This allows implementations to manage their own object ids in a
\&        way the implementation can control clients can expect one id to
\&        map to one object. For sequences with no accession number, this
\&        method should return a stringified memory location.
\&        This method sets the primary_id for the Quality
\&        object.
\& Returns : A string. (the value of primary_id)
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new primary_id for
\&        the Quality object.

\& Function: Get/set description text for this Quality object.
\& Returns : A string. (the value of desc)
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new desc for the
\&           Quality object.
.Ve
.SS "\fBid()\fP"
.IX Subsection "id()"
.Vb 8
\& Title   : id()
\& Usage   : $id = $qual\->id();
\& Function: Return the ID of the quality. This should normally be (and
\&        actually is in the implementation provided here) just a synonym
\&        for display_id().
\& Returns : A string. (the value of id)
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new id for the

\& Function: Returns the sequence that is contained in the imbedded in the
\&        PrimarySeq object within the Quality object
\& Returns : A scalar (the seq() value for the imbedded PrimarySeq object.)
\& Args    : If a scalar is provided, the Quality object will
\&        attempt to set that as the sequence for the imbedded PrimarySeq
\&        object. Otherwise, the value of seq() for the PrimarySeq object
\&        is returned.
\& Notes   : This is probably not a good idea because you then should call
\&        length() to make sure that the sequence and quality are of the
\&        same length. Even then, how can you make sure that this sequence
\&        belongs with that quality? I provided this to give you rope to
