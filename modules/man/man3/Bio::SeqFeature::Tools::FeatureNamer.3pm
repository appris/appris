.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a helper class for providing names for SeqFeatures
.PP
The Bio::SeqFeatureI class provides a display_name
method. Typically the display_name is not set when parsing formats
such as genbank \- instead properties such as \fBlabel\fR, \fBproduct\fR or
\&\fBgene\fR are set in a somewhat inconsistent manner.
.PP
In addition, when generating subfeatures (for example, exons that are
subfeatures of a transcript feature), it is often desirable to name
these subfeatures before either exporting to another format or
reporting to the user.
.PP
This module is intended to help given uniform display_names to
features and their subfeatures.
.SH "TODO"
.IX Header "TODO"
Currently the naming policy is hardcoded. It may be desirable to allow
plugging in variations on naming policies; this could be done either
by subclassing, anonymous subroutines (closures) or
parameterization. Contact the author if you feel you have need for a
different naming policy

\& Function: sets display_name
\& Example :
\& Returns : 
\& Args    : L<Bio::SeqFeatureI>
.Ve
.PP
This method calls \fBgenerate_feature_name()\fR and uses the returned value
to set the display_name of the feature
.SS "name_contained_features"
.IX Subsection "name_contained_features"
.Vb 6
\& Title   : name_contained_features
\& Usage   : $namer\->name_contained_features($sf);
\& Function: sets display_name for all features contained by sf
\& Example :
\& Returns : 
\& Args    : L<Bio::SeqFeatureI>
.Ve
.PP
iterates through all subfeatures of a certain feature (using
get_all_SeqFeatures) and names each subfeatures, based on the
generated name for the holder feature
.PP
A subfeature is named by concatenating the generated name of the
container feature with the type and a number.
.PP
For example, if the containing feature is a gene with display name
\&\fBdpp\fR, subfeatures will be named dpp\-mRNA\-1 dpp\-mRNA2 dpp\-exon1
dpp\-exon2 etc
.SS "generate_feature_name"
.IX Subsection "generate_feature_name"
.Vb 6
\& Title   : generate_feature_name
\& Usage   : $name = $namer\->generate_feature_name($sf);
\& Function: derives a sensible human readable name for a $sf

\& Returns : str
\& Args    : L<Bio::SeqFeatureI>
.Ve

returns a generated name (but does not actually set display_name).
.PP
If display_name is already set, the method will return this
.PP
Otherwise, the name will depend on the property:
