Bio::Factory::ObjectBuilderI \- Interface for an object builder
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Give standard usage here
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
An object builder is different from an object factory in that it
accumulates information for the object and finally, or constantly,
depending on the implementation, builds the object. It also allows for
implementations that can tell the information feed in which kind of
information the builder is interested in which not. In addition, the
implementation may choose to filter, transform, or completely ignore
certain content it is fed for certain slots.
.PP
Implementations will hence be mostly used by stream-based parsers to
parse only desired content, and/or skip over undesired entries.

.SS "want_slot"
.IX Subsection "want_slot"
.Vb 4
\& Title   : want_slot
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Whether or not the object builder wants to populate the
\&           specified slot of the object to be built.
\&
\&           The slot can be specified either as the name of the
\&           respective method, or the initialization parameter that
\&           would be otherwise passed to new() of the object to be
\&           built.
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : TRUE if the object builder wants to populate the slot, and
\&           FALSE otherwise.
\& Args    : the name of the slot (a string)
.Ve
.SS "add_slot_value"
.IX Subsection "add_slot_value"
.Vb 4
\& Title   : add_slot_value
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Adds one or more values to the specified slot of the object
\&           to be built.
\&
\&           Naming the slot is the same as for want_slot().
\&
\&           The object builder may further filter the content to be
\&           set, or even completely ignore the request.
\&
\&           If this method reports failure, the caller should not add
\&           more values to the same slot. In addition, the caller may
\&           find it appropriate to abandon the object being built
\&           altogether.
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : TRUE on success, and FALSE otherwise
\& Args    : the name of the slot (a string)
\&           parameters determining the value to be set
.Ve
.SS "want_object"
.IX Subsection "want_object"
.Vb 4
\& Title   : want_object
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Whether or not the object builder is still interested in
\&           continuing with the object being built.
\&
\&           If this method returns FALSE, the caller should not add any
\&           more values to slots, or otherwise risks that the builder
\&           throws an exception. In addition, make_object() is likely
\&           to return undef after this method returned FALSE.
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : TRUE if the object builder wants to continue building
\&           the present object, and FALSE otherwise.
\& Args    : none
.Ve
.SS "make_object"
.IX Subsection "make_object"
.Vb 3
\& Title   : make_object
\& Usage   :
\& Function: Get the built object.
\&
\&           This method is allowed to return undef if no value has ever
\&           been added since the last call to make_object(), or if
\&           want_object() returned FALSE (or would have returned FALSE)
\&           before calling this method.
\&
\&           For an implementation that allows consecutive building of
\&           objects, a caller must call this method once, and only
\&           once, between subsequent objects to be built. I.e., a call
\&           to make_object implies \*(Aqend_object.\*(Aq
\&
\& Example :
\& Returns : the object that was built
\& Args    : none
